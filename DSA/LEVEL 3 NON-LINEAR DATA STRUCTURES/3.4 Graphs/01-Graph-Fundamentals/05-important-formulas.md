| Property | Undirected | Directed |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Max edges (simple) | V(V-1)/2 | V(V-1) |
| Sum of degrees | 2E | Σ in-deg = Σ out-deg = E |
| Tree edges | V - 1 | — |
| Connected ⟹ min edges | V - 1 | — |
| Complete graph edges | V(V-1)/2 | V(V-1) |
| Bipartite max edges | ⌊V²/4⌋ | — |
