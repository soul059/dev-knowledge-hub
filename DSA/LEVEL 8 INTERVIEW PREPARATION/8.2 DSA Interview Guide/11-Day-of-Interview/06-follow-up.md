## Quick Revision Questions

1. **When should you send a thank-you email?**
   - Within 24 hours of the interview — it shows professionalism and reinforces your interest in the role

2. **What should you include in a thank-you email?**
   - Thank them for their time, reference something specific from the conversation, reaffirm your interest, and keep it to 5-8 sentences

3. **How many times should you follow up if there's no response?**
   - Maximum 2 times — once at Day 7 and once at Day 14; after that, move on mentally while keeping the door open
