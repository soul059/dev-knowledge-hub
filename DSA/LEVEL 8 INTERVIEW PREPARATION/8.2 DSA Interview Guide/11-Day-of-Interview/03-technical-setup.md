## Overview

Technical issues during an interview create unnecessary stress and eat into your time. A proper setup ensures you spend 100% of your mental energy on the problem, not on fixing audio, finding links, or fighting your coding environment.

## Environment Setup

```
PHYSICAL SPACE:
  ☐ Quiet room with door closed
  ☐ Good lighting (face should be visible on camera)
  ☐ Clean, uncluttered background
  ☐ Stable desk or table
  ☐ Comfortable chair (you'll sit for 45-60 min)
  ☐ Glass of water within reach
  ☐ Pen and paper for scratch work
  ☐ Phone on silent (not vibrate)
  ☐ Pets secured in another room
  ☐ "Do not disturb" sign on door (if needed)

LIGHTING TIPS:
  ✓ Light source in FRONT of you (facing you)
  ✗ Light source BEHIND you (silhouettes your face)
  ✓ Natural daylight from a window beside you
  ✗ Overhead fluorescent only (harsh shadows)
```

## Coding Platform Preparation

```
COMMON PLATFORMS AND TIPS:

  CODERPAD / HACKERRANK:
    ✓ Practice in the platform before the interview
    ✓ Know where the language selector is
    ✓ Know how to run code
    ✓ Familiarize with the editor shortcuts
    ✗ Don't rely on autocomplete (may not be available)

  GOOGLE DOCS:
    ✓ Practice coding WITHOUT syntax highlighting
    ✓ Practice without autocomplete
    ✓ Use monospace font (Courier New)
    ✓ Indentation matters even more here

  WHITEBOARD (ON-SITE):
    ✓ Practice writing code by hand
    ✓ Write larger than you think (readability)
    ✓ Plan space: top for approach, middle for code
    ✓ Bring your own markers if allowed

  YOUR OWN IDE (Screen share):
    ✓ Use a clean window with large font
    ✓ Font size: 16-18pt minimum
    ✓ Light theme (easier for others to read)
    ✓ Close all other tabs/files
    ✓ Disable distracting extensions
```

## IDE Settings for Interview

```
RECOMMENDED SETTINGS:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

  │ Theme:          Light (better screen sharing)       │
  │ Tab size:       4 spaces                            │
  │ Word wrap:      On                                  │
  │ Line numbers:   On                                  │
  │ Minimap:        Off (saves space)                   │
  │ Side panel:     Closed                              │
  │ Terminal:       Open at bottom (if needed)          │
  │ Extensions:     Disable heavy ones                  │
  │ Autocomplete:   Depends on company policy           │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

SCREEN SHARE TIP:
  Right-click desktop → Display settings
  → Set to a standard resolution (1920x1080)
  → Don't use ultra-wide or 4K scaling

## If Something Goes Wrong

```
COMMON ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS:

  Internet drops:
    → Switch to phone hotspot
    → Message recruiter immediately
    → Most companies will reschedule

  Audio not working:
    → Join by phone for audio
    → Keep screen share on computer
    → Have the dial-in number ready

  Platform not loading:
    → Clear browser cache
    → Try incognito/private browsing
    → Try a different browser (Chrome preferred)
    → Tell interviewer, ask to use Google Docs

  Computer crash:
    → Rejoin from phone immediately
    → Explain briefly (don't over-apologize)
    → Companies understand tech issues

KEY RULE: Communicate immediately when issues arise.
Don't suffer in silence or try to fix for 10 min.

## Quick Revision Questions

1. **What's the most important hardware to test?**
   - Internet connection, microphone, and webcam — technical failures in these cause the most disruption

2. **What IDE settings should you use for screen sharing?**
   - 16-18pt font, light theme, line numbers on, minimap off, and a clean workspace with no unnecessary panels

3. **What should you do if your internet drops mid-interview?**
   - Switch to phone hotspot immediately and message the recruiter — most companies will accommodate or reschedule

4. **How should you prepare for whiteboard interviews?**
   - Practice writing code by hand, plan your board space (approach on top, code in middle), and write larger than you think necessary

5. **What backup equipment should you have ready?**
   - Charged phone with hotspot capability, interview link accessible from phone, and the recruiter's phone number

6. **When should you test the interview platform?**
   - 2-3 days before, not the day of — this gives time to troubleshoot any issues with the platform
