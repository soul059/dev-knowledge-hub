## Overview

What you do after an interview is just as important as the interview itself. Proper post-interview reflection turns every interview — good or bad — into a learning experience that makes you stronger for the next one.

## Solving the Problem Properly (Post-Interview)

```
AFTER THE INTERVIEW, SOLVE THE PROBLEM FULLY:

  1. Re-solve the problem from scratch
     → Don't look at your interview code
     → Write clean, optimal solution
     → Handle ALL edge cases

  2. Find the optimal solution online
     → LeetCode discussion, tutorials
     → Compare with your approach

  3. Understand the gap
     → Why didn't you think of optimal?
     → What concept were you missing?
     → Add to your study plan

  4. Practice similar problems (2-3 more)
     → Search same tags/categories
     → Solidify the pattern

  EXAMPLE LEARNING LOOP:

    Interview: Failed on "Longest Substring
               Without Repeating Characters"
        ↓
    Gap: Didn't know Sliding Window pattern
        ↓
    Study: Learn Sliding Window technique
        ↓
    Practice: Solve 5 Sliding Window problems
        ↓
    Result: Next interview → solved similar
            problem in 15 minutes
```

## Emotional Management

REMEMBER THESE TRUTHS:

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │                                                     │
  │  "A bad interview ≠ A bad engineer"                │
  │                                                     │
  │  "Rejection ≠ You're not good enough"              │
  │       ↳ It means "not the right fit right now"     │
  │                                                     │
  │  "Every interview makes you better"                │
  │       ↳ Even the worst ones teach something        │
  │                                                     │
  │  "Top engineers failed many interviews too"         │
  │       ↳ It's a numbers game + skill building       │
  │                                                     │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

HEALTHY POST-INTERVIEW HABITS:
  ✓ Take a 1-hour break after the interview
  ✓ Do something enjoyable (walk, food, hobby)
  ✓ Don't obsess over "did I pass?"
  ✓ Don't post-mortem with others excessively
  ✓ Journal your feelings, then move forward
  ✓ Start preparing for the next opportunity

UNHEALTHY HABITS TO AVOID:
  ✗ Replaying every mistake in your head
  ✗ Comparing yourself to others
  ✗ Giving up after a rejection
  ✗ Avoiding future interviews out of fear

## Quick Revision Questions

1. **Why should you debrief within 30 minutes of the interview?**
   - Memory fades quickly — details about the problem, your approach, hints given, and mistakes made become hazy if not recorded immediately

2. **What should your interview journal include?**
   - Problem description and category, your approach vs. optimal, completion status, communication checklist, 1-5 self-ratings, key takeaway, and action item

3. **What should you do if you failed a problem in the interview?**
   - Re-solve it from scratch, find the optimal solution, identify the gap in your knowledge, then practice 2-3 similar problems to solidify the pattern

4. **How should you handle rejection emotionally?**
   - Take a break, remind yourself rejection means "not the right fit right now" not "not good enough," journal your feelings, then redirect energy to preparation

5. **Why should you track interviews over time?**
   - To identify patterns — which topics keep causing failures, whether communication is improving, and which company interview styles suit you best

6. **What's the most valuable thing to extract from every interview?**
   - The key learning and action item — every interview should result in a specific, actionable improvement to your preparation (e.g., "learn sliding window pattern")
