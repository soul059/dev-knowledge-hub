CREATE THIS BEFORE YOUR INTERVIEW DAY:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ MY INTERVIEW CHEAT SHEET                                │
│                                                          │
│ APPROACH FRAMEWORK:                                      │
│   1. Clarify → 2. Plan → 3. Code → 4. Test             │
│                                                          │
│ PATTERN TRIGGERS:                                        │
│   Pairs/lookup    → Hash Map                             │
│   Sorted + pairs  → Two Pointers                        │
│   Subarray        → Sliding Window                      │
│   Sorted search   → Binary Search                       │
│   Tree traversal  → DFS recursion or BFS queue          │
│   Connected parts → BFS/DFS/Union-Find                  │
│   Optimal value   → DP or Greedy                        │
│   k-th element    → Heap                                │
│                                                          │
│ COMPLEXITY CHEAT:                                        │
│   n ≤ 10   → O(n!) brute OK                             │
│   n ≤ 20   → O(2^n) possible                            │
│   n ≤ 1000 → O(n²) OK                                   │
│   n ≤ 10^5 → O(n log n) needed                          │
│   n ≤ 10^6 → O(n) needed                                │

│ REMINDERS:                                               │
│   - Ask 5+ clarifying questions                         │
│   - State approach before coding                        │
│   - Talk throughout — never go silent                   │
│   - Test with examples when done                        │
│   - Stay calm if stuck — use STUCK framework            │

## Quick Revision Questions

1. **Should you study hard the day before an interview?**
   - No — light review only (30 min max). Sleep and mental rest are more valuable than last-minute cramming

2. **What's the most important thing to test before the interview?**
   - Your internet connection, webcam, microphone, and the interview platform itself

3. **What should be on your 1-page cheat sheet?**
   - The approach framework, pattern triggers, complexity cheat sheet, and key behavioral reminders

4. **How should you warm up on interview morning?**
   - Solve 1 easy problem for confidence, review your cheat sheet, and do some light physical activity

5. **When should you join the meeting room?**
   - 2-5 minutes early — shows punctuality without being awkwardly early

6. **What's the biggest day-before mistake?**
   - Learning new topics or attempting hard problems — this destroys confidence and causes anxiety
