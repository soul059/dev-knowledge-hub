## Research Strategy for Target Company

```
HOW TO RESEARCH A COMPANY'S INTERVIEW STYLE:

1. LEETCODE DISCUSS
   → Search "[Company Name] interview"
   → Sort by recency (last 6 months)
   → Note most common topics and problems

2. GLASSDOOR
   → Read interview experience reviews
   → Look for patterns in question types

3. BLIND (TEAMBLIND)
   → Anonymous reports from employees
   → Most current interview information

4. YOUTUBE
   → Search "[Company] coding interview experience"
   → Watch walkthrough videos

5. COMPANY ENGINEERING BLOG
   → Understand their tech stack
   → Align solutions to their domain

TEMPLATE FOR RESEARCH NOTES:
  Company: _______________
  # of rounds: ___
  Time per round: ___
  Top 3 topics: _______________
  Recent problems reported: _______________
  Special aspects: _______________
```

## Customizing Your Study Plan

```
STEP 1: Identify target companies (top 3)
STEP 2: Research their interview patterns
STEP 3: Find topic overlap across targets
STEP 4: Prioritize overlapping topics

EXAMPLE:
  Target 1: Google (Graphs, DP, Binary Search)
  Target 2: Meta (Arrays, Trees, Graphs)
  Target 3: Amazon (Trees, Arrays, BFS/DFS)
  
  Overlap: Trees, Graphs/BFS/DFS, Arrays
  → Heavy focus on trees and graph traversals
  → Secondary focus on DP and Binary Search
  → Arrays are universal — already covered

ADJUST STUDY TIME:
  Core (all companies): 60% of time
  Company-specific topics: 30% of time
  Mock interviews: 10% of time
```

## Summary Table

| Company | #1 Topic | #2 Topic | #3 Topic | Unique Aspect |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|---------------|
| Google | Graphs | DP | Binary Search | Hard problems, follow-ups |
| Amazon | Trees | Arrays | BFS/DFS | Leadership Principles |
| Meta | Arrays | Trees | Graphs | Speed matters, 2 problems |
| Microsoft | Arrays | Linked Lists | Trees | Data structure design |
| Apple | Trees | Arrays | OOP | Longer interview process |

## Quick Revision Questions

1. **Which company emphasizes graph problems the most?**
   - Google — they frequently ask BFS/DFS, shortest path, topological sort, and graph-based optimization

2. **What's unique about Amazon interviews?**
   - Leadership Principles are evaluated alongside coding; every answer should connect to Amazon's LPs

3. **Why is speed important at Meta interviews?**
   - Meta often gives 2 problems in a 45-minute interview, so you need to solve each quickly and efficiently

4. **How should you research a company's interview style?**
   - Check LeetCode Discuss, Glassdoor, Blind, YouTube experiences, and the company's engineering blog

5. **How do startups differ from big tech in interviews?**
   - Startups focus more on practical coding ability — take-home projects, real-world problems, fewer algorithmic puzzles

6. **How do you customize prep for multiple target companies?**
   - Find topic overlap across your targets, prioritize shared topics, then add company-specific topics with remaining time
