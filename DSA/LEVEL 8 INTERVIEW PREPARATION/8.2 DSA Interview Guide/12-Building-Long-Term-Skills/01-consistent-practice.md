## Overview

Talent is overrated — consistency wins. The engineers who ace FAANG interviews don't cram for two weeks; they build daily habits over months. This chapter covers how to create and maintain a sustainable practice routine that compounds over time.

## The Power of Consistency

```
CRAMMING vs CONSISTENT PRACTICE:

  Cramming (2 weeks before interview):
    Skill ▲
         │            ╱╲
         │           ╱  ╲
         │          ╱    ╲
         │         ╱      ╲ ← Rapid decay
         │________╱        ╲________
         └────────────────────────── Time
              ↑ Interview

  Consistent (30 min/day for 6 months):
    Skill ▲
         │                    ╱────── Plateau
         │                ╱──╱ (high level)
         │            ╱──╱
         │        ╱──╱
         │    ╱──╱
         │╱──╱
         └────────────────────────── Time
              ↑ Interview (any time works)

  KEY: Consistent practice builds durable skill.
       Cramming builds fragile, temporary knowledge.

## Daily Practice Framework

```
THE 30-60-90 RULE:

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  MINIMUM (30 min/day):                          │
  │    → 1 easy/medium problem                      │
  │    → Review one concept                         │
  │    → Good for maintenance mode                  │
  │                                                 │
  │  STANDARD (60 min/day):                         │
  │    → 1-2 problems (mix of difficulty)           │
  │    → Review + learn one new pattern             │
  │    → Good for steady improvement                │
  │                                                 │
  │  INTENSIVE (90 min/day):                        │
  │    → 2-3 problems                               │
  │    → Deep study of one topic                    │
  │    → Mock interview once a week                 │
  │    → Best for active interview prep             │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Building the Habit

```
HABIT FORMATION SCIENCE:

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │                                                 │
  │  CUE → ROUTINE → REWARD                        │
  │                                                 │
  │  CUE:     Same time, same place every day       │
  │           "After my morning coffee, I solve      │
  │            one LeetCode problem"                 │
  │                                                 │
  │  ROUTINE: The practice itself                   │
  │           Keep it small enough to never skip     │
  │                                                 │
  │  REWARD:  Track your streak                     │
  │           Check off your calendar               │
  │           Feel the satisfaction of progress      │
  │                                                 │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

THE TWO-MINUTE RULE:
  "If you don't feel like practicing, commit to
   just 2 minutes. Open LeetCode and read one 
   problem. Usually, starting is the hardest part
   — once you begin, you'll keep going."

STREAK TRACKING:
  Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun
   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓   ← Week 1
   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✗   ✓   ← Week 2 (1 miss OK)
   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓   ← Week 3
   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓   ← Week 4

  Rule: Never miss two days in a row.

## Problem Selection Strategy

```
DAILY PROBLEM MIX:

  Week Structure (5-6 practice days):
  ┌──────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Day      │ Focus                                │
  ├──────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Monday   │ Arrays / Strings (Medium)            │
  │ Tuesday  │ Trees / Graphs (Medium)              │
  │ Wednesday│ Dynamic Programming (Easy → Medium)  │
  │ Thursday │ Mixed topic (review weak areas)      │
  │ Friday   │ Hard problem (attempt, don't stress) │
  │ Saturday │ Review week's problems               │
  │ Sunday   │ Rest or light review                 │
  └──────────┴──────────────────────────────────────┘

DIFFICULTY PROGRESSION:
  Month 1:  80% Easy, 20% Medium
  Month 2:  40% Easy, 50% Medium, 10% Hard
  Month 3:  10% Easy, 60% Medium, 30% Hard
  Month 4+: 0% Easy, 50% Medium, 50% Hard
```

## Dealing with Plateaus

```
SIGNS OF A PLATEAU:
  → Same problems take the same time
  → Can't seem to solve medium problems independently
  → Feeling bored or unmotivated
  → Scores on mock interviews not improving

BREAKING THROUGH:

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  1. CHANGE YOUR APPROACH                        │
  │     → Study solutions before solving             │
  │     → Learn the pattern, then apply it           │
  │                                                 │
  │  2. GO DEEPER, NOT WIDER                        │
  │     → Master one topic completely                │
  │     → Solve 10 problems of the same pattern     │
  │                                                 │
  │  3. TEACH SOMEONE                               │
  │     → Explain a concept to a friend             │
  │     → Write a blog post or notes                │
  │                                                 │
  │  4. TAKE A STRATEGIC BREAK                      │
  │     → 2-3 days off can reset your brain          │
  │     → Come back with fresh perspective          │
  │                                                 │
  │  5. DO MOCK INTERVIEWS                          │
  │     → Real pressure reveals real gaps            │
  │     → Feedback from others is invaluable        │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Summary Table

| Principle | Action | Why It Works |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Consistency | Same time daily | Builds habit |
| Small starts | 30 min minimum | Prevents burnout |
| Streak tracking | Calendar or app | Motivation |
| Difficulty progression | Easy → Hard over months | Gradual growth |
| Weekly review | Saturday review | Reinforcement |
| Strategic breaks | 2-3 days when plateaued | Mental reset |

## Quick Revision Questions

1. **Why is consistent practice better than cramming?**
   - Consistent practice builds durable, long-lasting skills through spaced repetition; cramming creates fragile knowledge that decays rapidly after the interview

2. **What's the minimum daily practice to maintain skills?**
   - 30 minutes per day — enough for one problem and a concept review; this maintains your skill level even during busy periods

3. **How do you build a sustainable practice habit?**
   - Use the Cue → Routine → Reward loop: practice at the same time and place daily, keep sessions small enough to never skip, and track your streak

4. **What should you do when hitting a plateau?**
   - Change your approach (study solutions first), go deeper in one topic (10 similar problems), teach someone, take a strategic 2-3 day break, or do mock interviews

5. **How should difficulty progress over time?**
   - Month 1: mostly Easy; Month 2: mostly Medium; Month 3: mix of Medium and Hard; Month 4+: equal Medium and Hard

6. **How many problems do you need to solve to be interview-ready?**
   - Around 200-300 well-understood problems covering all major topics — it's about quality and pattern recognition, not just the count
