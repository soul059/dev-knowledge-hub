  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │                                                     │
  │  1. NEVER STOP LEARNING                             │
  │     → Technology changes; curiosity is your edge    │
  │                                                     │
  │  2. EMBRACE DISCOMFORT                              │
  │     → Growth happens outside your comfort zone      │
  │     → If it's easy, you're not growing              │
  │                                                     │

  │                                                     │
  │  4. FOCUS ON IMPACT, NOT HOURS                      │
  │     → Quality of work > quantity of time            │
  │     → Solve the right problems                      │
  │                                                     │
  │  5. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF                           │
  │     → Burnout is real and preventable               │
  │     → Rest is productive                            │
  │     → Health enables everything else                │
  │                                                     │
  │  6. PLAY THE LONG GAME                              │
  │     → Careers are marathons, not sprints            │
  │     → Compound growth rewards consistency           │
  │     → Today's effort builds tomorrow's success      │
  │                                                     │
