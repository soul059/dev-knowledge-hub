## Overview

Depth in patterns is essential, but you also need **breadth** across different problem types. Interviews can throw anything at you. This chapter covers how to build variety into your practice systematically.

## Why Variety Matters

```
THE VARIETY PROBLEM:
  If you only practiced:        You'll struggle with:
  Arrays + Hash Maps     →     Graph problems
  Only Easy problems     →     Medium/Hard complexity
  Only coding            →     Design questions
  Only one language      →     Language-specific tricks
  Only timed practice    →     Deep understanding

THE GOAL:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Be competent in ALL topic areas                     │
  │ Be excellent in your strengths                      │
  │ Have no catastrophic blind spots                    │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Problem Type Coverage Map

```
ENSURE YOU'VE SOLVED AT LEAST 2-3 PROBLEMS IN EACH:

DATA STRUCTURES:
  ☐ Array / List manipulation
  ☐ String processing
  ☐ Hash Map / Hash Set
  ☐ Stack
  ☐ Queue / Deque
  ☐ Linked List (singly + doubly)
  ☐ Binary Tree
  ☐ BST (Binary Search Tree)
  ☐ Heap / Priority Queue
  ☐ Graph (adjacency list)
  ☐ Trie (bonus)

ALGORITHMS:
  ☐ Binary Search (standard + on answer)
  ☐ Two Pointers (converging + parallel)
  ☐ Sliding Window (fixed + variable)
  ☐ BFS (trees + graphs)
  ☐ DFS (trees + graphs)
  ☐ Backtracking
  ☐ Dynamic Programming (1D + 2D)
  ☐ Greedy
  ☐ Sorting-based
  ☐ Divide and Conquer

PROBLEM PATTERNS:
  ☐ Find pair/triplet with target sum
  ☐ Find max/min subarray/substring
  ☐ Merge intervals
  ☐ Matrix traversal
  ☐ Tree path problems
  ☐ Graph connectivity
  ☐ Topological ordering
  ☐ Counting / combinatorics
  ☐ String matching
  ☐ Interval scheduling
```

## Difficulty Distribution

```
OPTIMAL DIFFICULTY MIX:

  Week 1-2 (Building Foundation):
    Easy: 60%  ████████████
    Med:  30%  ██████
    Hard: 10%  ██

  Week 3-6 (Building Strength):
    Easy: 20%  ████
    Med:  60%  ████████████
    Hard: 20%  ████

  Week 7+ (Interview Ready):
    Easy: 10%  ██
    Med:  60%  ████████████
    Hard: 30%  ██████

MOST INTERVIEW PROBLEMS ARE:
  Easy: 10%
  Medium: 70%  ← This is your target zone
  Hard: 20%
```

## Mixed Practice Sessions

```
AFTER COMPLETING PATTERN-BASED PRACTICE:

DAY TYPE 1: Random Mix Day (weekly)
  → Use LeetCode random button
  → No topic filter
  → Timer on
  → Goal: test pattern recognition cold

DAY TYPE 2: Weak Area Focus (2x weekly)
  → Pick your lowest-confidence topic
  → Solve 3 problems in that area
  → Goal: eliminate blind spots

DAY TYPE 3: Contest Simulation (weekly)
  → LeetCode weekly contest (Sundays)
  → 4 problems, 90 minutes
  → Goal: practice speed + variety together

DAY TYPE 4: Follow-up Chain (weekly)
  → Solve a problem, then its variations:
    Two Sum → 3Sum → 4Sum → kSum
    Or: Binary Search → Rotated → 2D Matrix
  → Goal: deepen pattern understanding
```

---

## Problem Variation Types

```
FOR EACH CORE PROBLEM, PRACTICE VARIATIONS:

EXAMPLE: Two Sum
  Base:     Find two numbers that sum to target (hash map)
  Sorted:   Input is sorted (two pointers)
  Multiple: Find all pairs (avoid duplicates)
  Count:    Count number of pairs
  3Sum:     Three numbers that sum to target
  Closest:  Pair closest to target
  Stream:   Numbers arrive one at a time (design)

EXAMPLE: BFS
  Base:     Level order traversal of tree
  Shortest: Shortest path in unweighted graph
  Matrix:   Shortest path in grid
  Multi:    Multi-source BFS (01 Matrix)
  Bidirect: Bidirectional BFS (Word Ladder)
  State:    BFS with state (Minimum Knight Moves)

This builds FLEXIBLE understanding, not rigid memorization.

## Identifying Blind Spots

```
HOW TO FIND YOUR WEAK AREAS:

METHOD 1: Topic Success Rate
  Track solve rate by topic:
  ┌──────────────┬─────────┬───────────────┐
  │ Topic         │ Solved  │ Success Rate  │
  ├──────────────┼─────────┼───────────────┤
  │ Arrays        │ 12/14   │ 86% ✓         │
  │ Trees         │ 8/10    │ 80% ✓         │
  │ DP            │ 3/8     │ 38% ✗ WEAK    │
  │ Graphs        │ 4/7     │ 57% ✗ WEAK    │
  │ Linked Lists  │ 5/5     │ 100% ✓        │
  └──────────────┴─────────┴───────────────┘
  → Focus on DP and Graphs

METHOD 2: Contest Performance
  In mixed contests, which problems do you skip?
  Those are your blind spots.

METHOD 3: Pattern Recognition Test
  Can you identify the technique from the problem
  statement alone (without category tag)?
  If not → need more variety exposure.

## Summary Table

| Practice Type | Frequency | Purpose |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| Pattern-focused | Daily | Master specific techniques |
| Random mix | Weekly | Test pattern recognition |
| Weak area focus | 2x/week | Eliminate blind spots |
| Contest simulation | Weekly | Speed + variety combined |
| Follow-up chains | Weekly | Deepen pattern flexibility |

## Quick Revision Questions

1. **Why is problem variety important even if you know core patterns?**
   - Interviews can test any topic; variety ensures you have no catastrophic blind spots that could cost you the interview

2. **What's the optimal difficulty mix for mid-preparation?**
   - 20% Easy, 60% Medium, 20% Hard — most interview problems are medium difficulty

3. **How do you identify your weak areas?**
   - Track solve rate by topic; any topic below 60% success rate needs extra focused practice

4. **What's a 'follow-up chain' practice?**
   - Solving a base problem and then its increasingly complex variations (e.g., Two Sum → 3Sum → kSum) to build flexible understanding

5. **How often should you do random mixed practice?**
   - Once per week (after initial pattern-focused weeks) to test cold pattern recognition without topic hints

6. **What's the most tested difficulty level in real interviews?**
   - Medium — about 70% of interview problems are medium difficulty, making it the most important level to master
