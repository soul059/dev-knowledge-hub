## Course Overview

This comprehensive guide covers **everything you need to know** to ace DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) interviews at top tech companies. Unlike typical DSA courses that focus only on coding problems, this guide addresses the **complete interview experience** — from preparation strategy to communication skills, from problem-solving frameworks to post-interview follow-up.
