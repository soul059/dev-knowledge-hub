# Unit 2: Signal Operations

## Overview

This unit dives deeper into the mathematical operations that can be performed on signals. Building on the basic operations from Unit 1, we explore time-domain transformations in detail and introduce the critically important **convolution** operation — the fundamental tool for analyzing Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems.
