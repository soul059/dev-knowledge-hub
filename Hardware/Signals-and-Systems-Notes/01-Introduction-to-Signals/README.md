# Unit 1: Introduction to Signals

## Overview

This unit introduces the fundamental concept of a **signal** — a function that conveys information about a physical phenomenon. We explore how signals are classified, the basic operations that can be performed on them, and the standard elementary signals that serve as building blocks for more complex signal analysis.
