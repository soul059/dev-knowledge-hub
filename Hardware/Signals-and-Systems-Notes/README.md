# Signals and Systems - Comprehensive Study Notes

## Course Overview

**Signals and Systems** is a foundational course in Electrical Engineering, Electronics, and Communication Engineering that deals with the mathematical representation and analysis of signals and the systems that process them. This subject forms the backbone for understanding communication systems, control systems, digital signal processing, image processing, and many other engineering domains.

### What You Will Learn

- **Signal Representation**: How to mathematically describe and classify continuous-time and discrete-time signals
- **System Properties**: How to characterize and classify systems based on linearity, time-invariance, causality, and stability
- **Transform Techniques**: Fourier Series, Fourier Transform, Laplace Transform, and Z-Transform for signal and system analysis
- **LTI System Analysis**: Convolution, impulse response, and frequency response of Linear Time-Invariant systems
- **Sampling Theory**: The bridge between continuous-time and discrete-time domains

### Prerequisites

- Engineering Mathematics (Calculus, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra)
- Basic understanding of complex numbers and exponential functions
- Familiarity with basic circuit analysis concepts
