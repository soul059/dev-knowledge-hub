## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Define rational numbers and understand their properties
- Express rational numbers in standard form
- Represent rational numbers on a number line
- Perform operations with rational numbers
- Understand the relationship between fractions and rational numbers

## 1. What are Rational Numbers?

### Definition
A **rational number** is any number that can be expressed as a fraction p/q where:
- **p** is an integer (numerator)
- **q** is a non-zero integer (denominator)
- The symbol ℚ represents rational numbers (from "Quotient")

```
ℚ = { p/q : p ∈ ℤ, q ∈ ℤ, q ≠ 0 }
```

### Examples of Rational Numbers
```
Fractions:       1/2, 3/4, -5/7, 22/7
Integers:        5 = 5/1, -3 = -3/1, 0 = 0/1
Decimals:        0.5 = 1/2, 0.333... = 1/3
Mixed Numbers:   2½ = 5/2
```

### Key Insight: All Integers are Rational Numbers
```
Every integer n can be written as n/1

Examples:
• 7 = 7/1 ∈ ℚ
• -15 = -15/1 ∈ ℚ
• 0 = 0/1 ∈ ℚ (0 divided by any non-zero number is 0)
```

### Why q ≠ 0?
```
Division by zero is UNDEFINED!

5/0 = ? (No answer exists)
• If 5/0 = x, then 5 = 0 × x = 0 ✗ (Contradiction!)

Therefore, denominator can NEVER be zero.
```

## 2. Standard Form of Rational Numbers

### Definition
A rational number is in **standard form** when:
1. The denominator is **positive**
2. The numerator and denominator have **no common factors** other than 1
3. The numerator and denominator are **coprime** (HCF = 1)

### Converting to Standard Form

**Step 1**: If denominator is negative, multiply both by -1
**Step 2**: Divide both numerator and denominator by their HCF

### Examples

**Example 1**: Convert -8/12 to standard form
```
Step 1: Denominator is positive (12 > 0) ✓
Step 2: Find HCF of 8 and 12
        Factors of 8: 1, 2, 4, 8
        Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
        HCF = 4

Step 3: Divide both by 4
        -8/12 = -8÷4 / 12÷4 = -2/3

Answer: -2/3 (Standard Form)
```

**Example 2**: Convert 15/-25 to standard form
```
Step 1: Denominator is negative, multiply by -1/-1
        15/-25 = (15 × -1) / (-25 × -1) = -15/25

Step 2: Find HCF of 15 and 25
        HCF = 5

Step 3: Divide both by 5
        -15/25 = -15÷5 / 25÷5 = -3/5

Answer: -3/5 (Standard Form)
```

**Example 3**: Convert -18/-24 to standard form
```
Step 1: Both negative, so positive result
        -18/-24 = 18/24 (or multiply by -1/-1)

Step 2: HCF of 18 and 24 = 6

Step 3: 18/24 = 18÷6 / 24÷6 = 3/4

Answer: 3/4 (Standard Form)
```

---

## 3. Equivalent Rational Numbers

### Definition
Two rational numbers are **equivalent** if they represent the same value.

### Creating Equivalent Fractions
Multiply or divide both numerator and denominator by the **same non-zero number**.

```
a/b = (a×k)/(b×k) = (a÷k)/(b÷k)  where k ≠ 0
```

### Examples
```
1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6 = 4/8 = 5/10 = ...

Proof: 1/2 = (1×2)/(2×2) = 2/4 ✓

-3/4 = -6/8 = -9/12 = -15/20 = ...

3/5 = 6/10 = 9/15 = 12/20 = ...
```

### Visual Representation
```
1/2 = 2/4 = 4/8

 1/2:  ┌─────────┬─────────┐
       │█████████│░░░░░░░░░│
       └─────────┴─────────┘
       
 2/4:  ┌────┬────┬────┬────┐
       │████│████│░░░░│░░░░│
       └────┴────┴────┴────┘
       
 4/8:  ┌──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──┬──┐
       │██│██│██│██│░░│░░│░░│░░│
       └──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┘

All represent the SAME portion!
```

## 4. Number Line Representation

### Representing Rational Numbers on a Number Line

**Method**: Divide the space between consecutive integers into equal parts

### Example 1: Represent 3/4 on a number line
```
Step 1: 3/4 lies between 0 and 1
Step 2: Divide the segment [0,1] into 4 equal parts
Step 3: Count 3 parts from 0

    0                              1
    |──────|──────|──────|──────|
    0     1/4    2/4    3/4     4/4
                         ↑
                        3/4
```

### Example 2: Represent -2/3 on a number line
```
Step 1: -2/3 lies between -1 and 0
Step 2: Divide the segment [-1,0] into 3 equal parts
Step 3: Count 2 parts from 0 (towards negative side)

   -1                              0                              1
    |──────|──────|──────|         |──────|──────|──────|
  -3/3   -2/3   -1/3    0         0     1/3    2/3    3/3
           ↑
         -2/3
```

### Example 3: Represent 5/2 on a number line
```
Step 1: Convert to mixed number: 5/2 = 2½
Step 2: 5/2 lies between 2 and 3
Step 3: Divide [2,3] into 2 parts, mark 1 part from 2

    0         1         2         3
    |─────────|─────────|────|────|
                        2   5/2   3
                             ↑
                            5/2 = 2½
```

### Complete Number Line with Rationals

    |─────|─────|─────|─────|─────|─────|
                    │
    Rational numbers fill EVERY point on this line
    (along with irrational numbers)
    
    Between any two rational numbers, there are 
    INFINITELY many more rational numbers!
```

## 5. Comparing Rational Numbers

### Method 1: Cross Multiplication

To compare a/b and c/d:
- If ad > bc, then a/b > c/d
- If ad < bc, then a/b < c/d
- If ad = bc, then a/b = c/d

### Example 1: Compare 3/4 and 5/7
```
Cross multiply:
3 × 7 = 21
4 × 5 = 20

Since 21 > 20,
3/4 > 5/7
```

### Method 2: Same Denominator

Convert to common denominator, then compare numerators.

### Example 2: Compare -5/6 and -7/8
```
LCM of 6 and 8 = 24

-5/6 = (-5 × 4)/(6 × 4) = -20/24
-7/8 = (-7 × 3)/(8 × 3) = -21/24

Since -20 > -21,
-5/6 > -7/8
```

### Method 3: Convert to Decimals

Divide numerator by denominator and compare decimal values.

### Example 3: Compare 2/5 and 3/8
```
2/5 = 0.4
3/8 = 0.375

Since 0.4 > 0.375,
2/5 > 3/8
```

### 💡 Quick Tip for Negative Rationals
```
For negative rationals, the one with SMALLER absolute value is GREATER.

Compare -2/3 and -5/6:
|-2/3| = 2/3 ≈ 0.667
|-5/6| = 5/6 ≈ 0.833

Since 0.667 < 0.833,
-2/3 > -5/6 (less negative = greater)
```

## 6. Operations on Rational Numbers

### Addition and Subtraction

#### Same Denominator
```
a/c + b/c = (a + b)/c
a/c - b/c = (a - b)/c
```

**Example**: 3/7 + 2/7 = (3+2)/7 = 5/7

#### Different Denominators
**Step 1**: Find LCM of denominators
**Step 2**: Convert to equivalent fractions
**Step 3**: Add or subtract numerators

**Example**: 2/3 + 3/4
```
Step 1: LCM of 3 and 4 = 12

Step 2: 2/3 = (2×4)/(3×4) = 8/12
        3/4 = (3×3)/(4×3) = 9/12

Step 3: 8/12 + 9/12 = 17/12

Answer: 17/12 or 1 5/12
```

**Example**: 5/6 - 3/8
```
Step 1: LCM of 6 and 8 = 24

Step 2: 5/6 = (5×4)/(6×4) = 20/24
        3/8 = (3×3)/(8×3) = 9/24

Step 3: 20/24 - 9/24 = 11/24

Answer: 11/24
```

### Multiplication

**Rule**: Multiply numerators together, multiply denominators together
```
a/b × c/d = (a×c)/(b×d)
```

**Example**: 2/3 × 4/5
```
= (2×4)/(3×5)
= 8/15
```

**Example with simplification**: 3/4 × 8/9
```
Method 1 (Direct):
= (3×8)/(4×9) = 24/36 = 2/3

Method 2 (Cancel first - FASTER):
= 3/4 × 8/9
= (3×8)/(4×9)
  ↓   ↓
Cross-cancel: 3 and 9 have common factor 3
              4 and 8 have common factor 4

= (1×2)/(1×3) = 2/3
```

### Division

**Rule**: Multiply by the reciprocal of the divisor
```
a/b ÷ c/d = a/b × d/c = (a×d)/(b×c)
```

**Example**: 2/3 ÷ 4/5
```
= 2/3 × 5/4
= (2×5)/(3×4)
= 10/12
= 5/6 (simplified)
```

**Example**: -5/6 ÷ 10/9
```
= -5/6 × 9/10
= (-5×9)/(6×10)
= -45/60
= -3/4 (simplified)
```

## 7. Properties of Rational Numbers

### Summary Table

| Property | Addition | Multiplication |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Closure** | a/b + c/d ∈ ℚ | a/b × c/d ∈ ℚ |
| **Commutative** | a/b + c/d = c/d + a/b | a/b × c/d = c/d × a/b |
| **Associative** | (a/b + c/d) + e/f = a/b + (c/d + e/f) | (a/b × c/d) × e/f = a/b × (c/d × e/f) |
| **Identity** | a/b + 0 = a/b | a/b × 1 = a/b |
| **Inverse** | a/b + (-a/b) = 0 | a/b × b/a = 1 (if a≠0) |
| **Distributive** | a/b × (c/d + e/f) = a/b × c/d + a/b × e/f |

### Multiplicative Inverse (Reciprocal)

The **reciprocal** of a/b is b/a (where a ≠ 0)

```
a/b × b/a = 1

Examples:
• Reciprocal of 2/3 is 3/2
• Reciprocal of -4/5 is -5/4 (or 5/-4)
• Reciprocal of 7 (= 7/1) is 1/7
• 0 has NO reciprocal (0/1 has no reciprocal 1/0)
```

## 8. Rational Numbers Between Two Numbers

### Key Concept
Between any two rational numbers, there are **infinitely many** rational numbers.

### Method 1: Average Method
To find a rational between a and b:
```
Rational number = (a + b) / 2
```

### Example: Find 3 rational numbers between 1/3 and 1/2
```
Step 1: Find one between 1/3 and 1/2
        Average = (1/3 + 1/2) ÷ 2
                = (2/6 + 3/6) ÷ 2
                = 5/6 ÷ 2
                = 5/12

Step 2: Find one between 1/3 and 5/12
        Average = (1/3 + 5/12) ÷ 2
                = (4/12 + 5/12) ÷ 2
                = 9/12 ÷ 2
                = 9/24 = 3/8

Step 3: Find one between 5/12 and 1/2
        Average = (5/12 + 1/2) ÷ 2
                = (5/12 + 6/12) ÷ 2
                = 11/12 ÷ 2
                = 11/24

Answer: 3/8, 5/12, 11/24 (all between 1/3 and 1/2)
```

### Method 2: Common Denominator Method
Convert to equivalent fractions with larger denominator.

### Example: Find 5 rational numbers between 3 and 4
```
Step 1: Write as fractions: 3/1 and 4/1
Step 2: Multiply both by 6/6 (to get more numbers between)
        3/1 = 18/6
        4/1 = 24/6
Step 3: Numbers between 18/6 and 24/6:
        19/6, 20/6, 21/6, 22/6, 23/6

Answer: 19/6, 10/3, 7/2, 11/3, 23/6
        (= 3⅙, 3⅓, 3½, 3⅔, 3⅚)
```

## 9. Solved Examples

### Example 1: Simplify (2/3 + 4/5) ÷ (1/2 - 1/3)

**Solution**:
```
Step 1: Solve the brackets
        Numerator: 2/3 + 4/5
        LCM of 3 and 5 = 15
        = 10/15 + 12/15 = 22/15

        Denominator: 1/2 - 1/3
        LCM of 2 and 3 = 6
        = 3/6 - 2/6 = 1/6

Step 2: Divide
        (22/15) ÷ (1/6)
        = 22/15 × 6/1
        = 132/15
        = 44/5

Answer: 44/5 or 8 4/5
```

### Example 2: The sum of two rational numbers is -5. If one of them is -13/6, find the other.

**Solution**:
```
Let the other number be x

x + (-13/6) = -5
x = -5 - (-13/6)
x = -5 + 13/6
x = -30/6 + 13/6
x = -17/6

Verification: -17/6 + (-13/6) = -30/6 = -5 ✓

Answer: -17/6
```

### Example 3: Find the product of additive inverse and multiplicative inverse of -2/3

**Solution**:
```
Additive inverse of -2/3 = 2/3  (sum = 0)
Multiplicative inverse of -2/3 = -3/2  (product = 1)

Product = 2/3 × (-3/2)
        = -6/6
        = -1

Answer: -1
```

### Example 4: Arrange in ascending order: 3/5, -2/3, 5/7, -1/2

**Solution**:
```
Step 1: LCM of 5, 3, 7, 2 = 210

Step 2: Convert each:
        3/5 = 126/210
        -2/3 = -140/210
        5/7 = 150/210
        -1/2 = -105/210

Step 3: Order numerators:
        -140 < -105 < 126 < 150

Step 4: Write original fractions:
        -2/3 < -1/2 < 3/5 < 5/7

Answer: -2/3, -1/2, 3/5, 5/7
```

### Example 5: If 2/5 of a number is 16, find 3/4 of the same number.

**Solution**:
```
Let the number be x

2/5 of x = 16
(2/5) × x = 16
x = 16 × 5/2
x = 80/2
x = 40

Now find 3/4 of 40:
3/4 × 40 = 120/4 = 30

Answer: 30
```

## 10. Mental Math Tricks 🧠

### Trick 1: Multiplying Fractions Mentally
```
Cancel common factors before multiplying

5/6 × 3/10 = ?

Cancel: 5 and 10 → 1 and 2
Cancel: 3 and 6 → 1 and 2

= 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4
```

### Trick 2: Quick Addition with Same Numerator
```
1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = ?

Find LCD (6):
