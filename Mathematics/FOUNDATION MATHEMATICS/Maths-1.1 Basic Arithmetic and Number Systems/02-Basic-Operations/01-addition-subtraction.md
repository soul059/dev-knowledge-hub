## 1. Understanding Addition

### Definition
**Addition** is the mathematical operation that combines two or more numbers to get their total, called the **sum**.

### Terminology
```
    5    +    3    =    8
    ↓         ↓         ↓
 Addend   Addend     Sum
 (First)  (Second)
```

### Visual Representation
```
Addition means combining:

●●●●● + ●●● = ●●●●●●●●
  5   +  3  =    8

On Number Line:
    0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
    |────|────|────|────|────●────|────|────●────|
                              Start        End
                              at 5    Move 3 →
                              5 + 3 = 8
```

---

## 2. Addition of Different Number Types

### Adding Natural Numbers
```
Standard column addition:

     358
   + 247
   ─────
     605

Step-by-step:
• Units: 8 + 7 = 15 (write 5, carry 1)
• Tens: 5 + 4 + 1 = 10 (write 0, carry 1)
• Hundreds: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
```

### Adding Integers

**Rule Summary**:
| Signs | Operation | Sign of Result |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| (+) + (+) | Add | Positive |
| (-) + (-) | Add | Negative |
| (+) + (-) | Subtract | Sign of larger magnitude |
| (-) + (+) | Subtract | Sign of larger magnitude |

**Examples**:
```
(+7) + (+5) = +12    (Add, keep positive)
(-7) + (-5) = -12    (Add, keep negative)
(+7) + (-5) = +2     (7-5=2, positive wins)
(-7) + (+5) = -2     (7-5=2, negative wins)
(+5) + (-7) = -2     (7-5=2, negative wins)
```

### Visual: Adding Integers on Number Line
```
Calculate: (-3) + (+7)

   -4   -3   -2   -1    0    1    2    3    4    5
    |────●────|────|────|────|────|────|────●────|
         ↑                                  ↑
      Start                              End
      at -3                           Move 7→
      
(-3) + (+7) = +4
```

```
Calculate: (+2) + (-6)

   -5   -4   -3   -2   -1    0    1    2    3
    |────●────|────|────|────|────|────●────|
         ↑                              ↑
        End                          Start
    ←Move 6                          at +2
    
(+2) + (-6) = -4
```

### Adding Fractions

**Same Denominator**: Add numerators directly
```
3/7 + 2/7 = (3+2)/7 = 5/7
```

**Different Denominators**: Find common denominator
```
2/3 + 1/4 = ?

Step 1: Find LCM of 3 and 4 = 12
Step 2: Convert: 2/3 = 8/12, 1/4 = 3/12
Step 3: Add: 8/12 + 3/12 = 11/12
```

### Adding Decimals

**Rule**: Align decimal points, then add as usual
```
    12.456
  +  3.78
  ────────
    16.236

Steps:
• Align decimal points
• Add zeros if needed: 3.78 → 3.780
• Add column by column
```

## 3. Understanding Subtraction

### Definition
**Subtraction** is the mathematical operation that finds the difference between two numbers.

### Terminology
```
    8    -    3    =    5
    ↓         ↓         ↓
Minuend  Subtrahend  Difference
```

### Relationship with Addition
```
Subtraction is the INVERSE of Addition

If:     a + b = c
Then:   c - b = a
And:    c - a = b

Example:
8 + 5 = 13
13 - 5 = 8
13 - 8 = 5
```

### Subtraction on Number Line
```
Calculate: 8 - 3

    0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
    |────|────|────|────|────●────|────|────●────|
                              ↑              ↑
                             End          Start
                         ←Move 3          at 8
    
8 - 3 = 5
```

---

## 4. Subtraction with Different Number Types

### Subtracting Integers

**Key Rule**: Subtracting is adding the opposite
```
a - b = a + (-b)
```

**Examples**:
```
(+8) - (+3) = (+8) + (-3) = +5
(+8) - (-3) = (+8) + (+3) = +11
(-8) - (+3) = (-8) + (-3) = -11
(-8) - (-3) = (-8) + (+3) = -5
```

### 💡 Memory Trick: "Keep, Change, Change"
```
Keep the first number
Change subtraction to addition
Change the sign of the second number

Example: 7 - (-4)
Keep: 7
Change: + (instead of -)
Change: +4 (instead of -4)
Answer: 7 + 4 = 11
```

### Subtracting Fractions

**Same Denominator**:
```
5/8 - 3/8 = (5-3)/8 = 2/8 = 1/4
```

**Different Denominators**:
```
3/4 - 2/5 = ?

Step 1: LCM of 4 and 5 = 20
Step 2: Convert: 3/4 = 15/20, 2/5 = 8/20
Step 3: Subtract: 15/20 - 8/20 = 7/20
```

### Subtracting Decimals
```
    15.43
  -  8.67
  ────────
     6.76

With borrowing:
    15.43     →    15.4³⁄₁₀
  -  8.67
  ────────
     6.76
```

## 5. Properties of Addition

### 1. Commutative Property
The order of addends doesn't affect the sum.
```
a + b = b + a

Examples:
5 + 3 = 3 + 5 = 8
(-7) + 4 = 4 + (-7) = -3
2.5 + 1.5 = 1.5 + 2.5 = 4
```

### 2. Associative Property
The grouping of addends doesn't affect the sum.
```
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)

Example:
(2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4)
    5 + 4 = 2 + 7
        9 = 9 ✓
```

### 3. Identity Property
Adding zero doesn't change the number.
```
a + 0 = a

Examples:
7 + 0 = 7
-5 + 0 = -5
3.14 + 0 = 3.14
```

### 4. Inverse Property
Every number has an opposite that sums to zero.
```
a + (-a) = 0

Examples:
7 + (-7) = 0
-5 + 5 = 0
√2 + (-√2) = 0
```

### 5. Closure Property
Adding two real numbers always gives a real number.
```
If a ∈ ℝ and b ∈ ℝ, then a + b ∈ ℝ

Examples:
3 + 5 = 8 ∈ ℝ
√2 + √3 ∈ ℝ
π + e ∈ ℝ
```

---

## 6. Properties of Subtraction

### Subtraction is NOT Commutative
```
a - b ≠ b - a (in general)

Example:
8 - 3 = 5
3 - 8 = -5
5 ≠ -5 ✗
```

### Subtraction is NOT Associative
```
(a - b) - c ≠ a - (b - c) (in general)

Example:
(10 - 4) - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4
10 - (4 - 2) = 10 - 2 = 8
4 ≠ 8 ✗
```

### Subtracting Zero
```
a - 0 = a

Example: 7 - 0 = 7
```

### Zero Minus a Number
```
0 - a = -a

Example: 0 - 7 = -7
```

---

## 7. Mental Math Strategies

### Strategy 1: Making Tens
```
8 + 7 = ?
Think: 8 + 2 = 10, then 10 + 5 = 15

8 + 7 = 8 + (2 + 5) = (8 + 2) + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15
```

### Strategy 2: Compensation
```
98 + 47 = ?
Think: 100 + 47 - 2 = 147 - 2 = 145

Or: 98 + 47 = 100 + 45 = 145
    (Add 2 to 98, subtract 2 from 47)
```

### Strategy 3: Breaking Apart
```
356 + 278 = ?

Break apart:
= 300 + 200 + 50 + 70 + 6 + 8
= 500 + 120 + 14
= 500 + 134
= 634
```

### Strategy 4: Counting Up (for Subtraction)
```
82 - 47 = ?

Count up from 47 to 82:
47 → 50 (add 3)
50 → 80 (add 30)
80 → 82 (add 2)

Total added: 3 + 30 + 2 = 35
So 82 - 47 = 35
```

### Strategy 5: Same Change
```
83 - 28 = ?

Add same amount to both:
83 + 2 = 85
28 + 2 = 30

85 - 30 = 55
So 83 - 28 = 55
```

### Strategy 6: Near Doubles
```
7 + 8 = ?
Think: 7 + 7 = 14, then 14 + 1 = 15
Or:    8 + 8 = 16, then 16 - 1 = 15
```

---

## 8. Addition and Subtraction with Multiple Numbers

### Adding Multiple Numbers
```
Find: 15 + 27 + 85 + 33

Strategy: Look for pairs that make "nice" numbers
= (15 + 85) + (27 + 33)
= 100 + 60
= 160
```

### Mixed Addition and Subtraction
```
Find: 45 + 32 - 17 + 8 - 13

Method 1: Left to Right
= 77 - 17 + 8 - 13
= 60 + 8 - 13
= 68 - 13
= 55

Method 2: Group positives and negatives
Positives: 45 + 32 + 8 = 85
Negatives: -17 - 13 = -30
Total: 85 + (-30) = 55
```

---

## 9. Solved Examples

### Example 1: Add 5678 + 3456
```
     5678
   + 3456
   ──────
     9134

Step by step:
• 8 + 6 = 14 (write 4, carry 1)
• 7 + 5 + 1 = 13 (write 3, carry 1)
• 6 + 4 + 1 = 11 (write 1, carry 1)
• 5 + 3 + 1 = 9

Answer: 9134
```

### Example 2: Subtract 5003 - 2876
```
     5003
   - 2876
   ──────
     2127

With borrowing:
     4 9 9
     5 0 0 13
   - 2 8 7 6
   ──────────
     2 1 2 7

Answer: 2127
```

### Example 3: Calculate (-15) + (+8) + (-3) + (+12) + (-7)
```
Method 1: Left to right
(-15) + (+8) = -7
(-7) + (-3) = -10
(-10) + (+12) = +2
(+2) + (-7) = -5

Method 2: Group by sign
Positives: +8 + 12 = +20
Negatives: -15 - 3 - 7 = -25
Total: 20 + (-25) = -5

Answer: -5
```

### Example 4: Add 3/4 + 5/6 + 1/3
```
Step 1: Find LCM of 4, 6, 3 = 12

Step 2: Convert all fractions:
3/4 = 9/12
5/6 = 10/12
1/3 = 4/12

Step 3: Add:
9/12 + 10/12 + 4/12 = 23/12 = 1 11/12

Answer: 23/12 or 1 11/12
```

### Example 5: Calculate 15.75 - 8.368
```
    15.750
  -  8.368
  ────────
     7.382

Answer: 7.382
```

### Example 6: Word Problem
A hiker climbs 850m up a mountain, then descends 320m into a valley, then climbs 475m. What is the net change in altitude?

**Solution**:
```
Net change = +850 - 320 + 475
           = 850 + 475 - 320
           = 1325 - 320
           = 1005m

The hiker is 1005m above the starting point.
```

### Example 7: Temperature Problem
The temperature at 6 AM was -8°C. By noon, it rose by 15°C. By midnight, it dropped by 12°C. What was the final temperature?

**Solution**:
```
Initial: -8°C
After rising 15°C: -8 + 15 = 7°C
After dropping 12°C: 7 - 12 = -5°C

Final temperature: -5°C
```
