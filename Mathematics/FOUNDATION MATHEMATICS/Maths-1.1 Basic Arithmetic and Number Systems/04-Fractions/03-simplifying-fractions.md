## 1. What is Simplifying?

### Definition
**Simplifying** (or reducing) a fraction means writing it in its **lowest terms** — the form where numerator and denominator have no common factors except 1.

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  A fraction a/b is in LOWEST TERMS when:             ║
║                                                       ║
║              HCF(a, b) = 1                           ║
║                                                       ║
║  (Numerator and denominator are co-prime)            ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Why Simplify?
```
• Easier to understand: 1/2 is clearer than 17/34
• Easier to compare: 3/4 vs 2/3 is simpler than 45/60 vs 40/60
• Required for final answers in most math problems
• Takes less space to write
```

### Visual: Same Value, Simpler Form
```
8/12 = 4/6 = 2/3

All represent the same amount:

8/12:  ████████░░░░
4/6:   ████░░
2/3:   ██░

Same proportion shaded, but 2/3 is simplest!
```

---

## 2. Method 1: HCF Method (One-Step)

### The Process
```
Step 1: Find HCF of numerator and denominator
Step 2: Divide both by the HCF
Step 3: Result is in lowest terms

Formula: a/b = (a ÷ HCF)/(b ÷ HCF)
```

### Example 1: Simplify 24/36
```
Find HCF(24, 36):

24 = 2³ × 3
36 = 2² × 3²
HCF = 2² × 3 = 12

24/36 = (24 ÷ 12)/(36 ÷ 12) = 2/3

Answer: 24/36 = 2/3
```

### Example 2: Simplify 45/75
```
Find HCF(45, 75):

45 = 3² × 5
75 = 3 × 5²
HCF = 3 × 5 = 15

45/75 = (45 ÷ 15)/(75 ÷ 15) = 3/5

Answer: 45/75 = 3/5
```

### Example 3: Simplify 84/126
```
Find HCF(84, 126):

84 = 2² × 3 × 7
126 = 2 × 3² × 7
HCF = 2 × 3 × 7 = 42

84/126 = (84 ÷ 42)/(126 ÷ 42) = 2/3

Answer: 84/126 = 2/3
```

---

## 3. Method 2: Step-by-Step Division

### The Process
```
Divide numerator and denominator by small primes
repeatedly until no common factors remain.

Good when HCF isn't obvious.
```

### Example 1: Simplify 48/72
```
48/72  (both even)
= 24/36 (÷2)
= 12/18 (÷2)
= 6/9   (÷2)
= 2/3   (÷3)

No more common factors!
Answer: 48/72 = 2/3
```

### Example 2: Simplify 150/225
```
150/225 (both ÷ by 5)
= 30/45  (÷5)
= 6/9    (÷5)
= 2/3    (÷3)

Answer: 150/225 = 2/3
```

### Example 3: Simplify 91/143
```
91/143

Try 7: 91 = 7 × 13, 143 = 7 × ?
143 ÷ 7 = 20.4... ✗

Try 11: 91 ÷ 11 = 8.3... ✗

Try 13: 91 = 7 × 13, 143 = 11 × 13 ✓

91/143 = 7/11 (÷13)

Answer: 91/143 = 7/11
```

---

## 4. Quick Simplification Tests

### Divisibility Checks
```
Before simplifying, check for common factors:

If BOTH are even → Divide by 2
If BOTH digit sums ÷ 3 → Divide by 3
If BOTH end in 0 or 5 → Divide by 5
```

### Table of Common Simplifications
```
2/4 = 1/2       3/6 = 1/2       4/8 = 1/2
3/9 = 1/3       4/12 = 1/3      5/15 = 1/3
4/6 = 2/3       6/9 = 2/3       8/12 = 2/3
3/12 = 1/4      6/8 = 3/4       9/12 = 3/4
2/10 = 1/5      4/10 = 2/5      6/10 = 3/5
```

### Already in Lowest Terms?
```
A fraction is already simplified when:
• HCF(numerator, denominator) = 1
• No common factors at all

Examples already in lowest terms:
3/7, 5/11, 7/9, 8/15, 11/13, 13/17
```

---

## 5. Simplifying Improper Fractions

### Same Method Applies
```
Simplify 18/12:

HCF(18, 12) = 6
18/12 = 3/2

Can also write as mixed number: 3/2 = 1 1/2
```

### Examples
```
20/8 = 5/2 = 2 1/2    (÷4)
35/21 = 5/3 = 1 2/3   (÷7)
48/18 = 8/3 = 2 2/3   (÷6)
```

### Process
```
Option 1: Simplify first, then convert
24/10 = 12/5 = 2 2/5

Option 2: Convert first, then simplify
24/10 = 2 4/10 = 2 2/5

Both give the same answer!
```

## 6. Simplifying Mixed Numbers

### Focus on the Fraction Part
```
Simplify 3 8/12:

Whole part stays: 3
Simplify fraction: 8/12 = 2/3

Answer: 3 8/12 = 3 2/3
```

### Examples
```
5 6/9 = 5 2/3       (6/9 = 2/3)
2 15/20 = 2 3/4     (15/20 = 3/4)
4 12/16 = 4 3/4     (12/16 = 3/4)
1 25/100 = 1 1/4    (25/100 = 1/4)
```

### When Fraction Part is Improper
```
Simplify 2 15/10:

15/10 = 3/2 = 1 1/2

2 + 1 1/2 = 3 1/2

Answer: 2 15/10 = 3 1/2
```

---

## 7. Simplifying Complex Fractions

### Definition
A **complex fraction** has a fraction in its numerator, denominator, or both.

```
     a/b
    ─────  is a complex fraction
     c/d
```

### Method: Multiply by Reciprocal
```
  a/b     a     c     a   d     ad
 ───── = ─── ÷ ─── = ─ × ─── = ────
  c/d     b     d     b   c     bc
```

### Example 1
```
  2/3       2     4
 ───── = ───── ÷ ─────
  4/5       3     5

        = 2/3 × 5/4
        = 10/12
        = 5/6
```

### Example 2
```
  3/4       3     9
 ───── = ───── ÷ ─────
  9/8       4     8

        = 3/4 × 8/9
        = 24/36
        = 2/3
```

### Example 3: With Whole Numbers
```
   3         3       7
 ───── = ─────── ÷ ─────
  7/2       1       2

        = 3/1 × 2/7
        = 6/7
```

## 8. Simplifying Expressions

### Addition/Subtraction Results
```
Simplify: 2/6 + 1/6

2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2

Always simplify after operations!
```

### Multiplication Results
```
Simplify: 4/5 × 15/16

Method 1 (Cancel first):
  4    15     1    3
 ─── × ──── = ─ × ─── = 3/4
  5    16     1    4

Method 2 (Multiply then simplify):
= 60/80 = 3/4

Canceling first is easier!
```

### Division Results
```
Simplify: 5/6 ÷ 10/9

= 5/6 × 9/10
= (5×9)/(6×10)
= 45/60
= 3/4
```

## 9. Solved Examples

### Example 1: Basic Simplification
```
Simplify 56/84

56 = 2³ × 7
84 = 2² × 3 × 7
HCF = 2² × 7 = 28

56/84 = 2/3
```

### Example 2: Step-by-Step
```
Simplify 180/240

180/240 (÷10)
= 18/24 (÷6)
= 3/4

Answer: 180/240 = 3/4
```

### Example 3: Large Numbers
```
Simplify 462/588

462 = 2 × 3 × 7 × 11
588 = 2² × 3 × 7²
HCF = 2 × 3 × 7 = 42

462/588 = 11/14
```

### Example 4: Expression
```
Simplify: 3/4 + 1/6 - 1/3

LCM(4, 6, 3) = 12

= 9/12 + 2/12 - 4/12
= (9 + 2 - 4)/12
= 7/12 ← Already in lowest terms
```

### Example 5: Complex Fraction
```
       1/2 + 1/4
Simplify ─────────
       1/2 - 1/4

Numerator: 1/2 + 1/4 = 2/4 + 1/4 = 3/4
Denominator: 1/2 - 1/4 = 2/4 - 1/4 = 1/4

= (3/4) ÷ (1/4)
= 3/4 × 4/1
= 12/4
= 3
```

### Example 6: Finding Simplest Form
```
Which fraction equals 5/8 and has denominator 56?

5/8 = ?/56

8 × 7 = 56
5 × 7 = 35

Answer: 35/56

Verify: 35/56 = 5/8 (÷7) ✓
```

## 10. Mental Math Tips 🧠

### Recognize Common Patterns
```
Any fraction with same numerator and denominator = 1
  5/5 = 1, 13/13 = 1, 100/100 = 1

Fractions ending in zeros:
  10/50 = 1/5 (remove one zero each)
  200/800 = 2/8 = 1/4 (remove two zeros)
```

### Quick Tricks
```
Divide by 2 if both even:
  86/124 → 43/62 (instantly!)

Check for 25:
  75/100 = 3/4 (both ÷ 25)

Powers of 10:
  30/100 = 3/10
  250/1000 = 25/100 = 1/4
```

### Spot Check: Is It Simplified?
```
Check if co-prime by testing small primes:

For 15/28:
• 15 is odd, 28 is even → no factor of 2
• 1+5=6 (÷3), but 28÷3 ✗ → no factor of 3
• 15 ends in 5, 28 doesn't → no factor of 5
• 15 = 3×5, 28 = 4×7 → no common factors

15/28 is already in lowest terms!
```
