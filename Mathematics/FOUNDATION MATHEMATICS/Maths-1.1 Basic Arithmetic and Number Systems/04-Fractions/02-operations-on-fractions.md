- Multiply fractions and mixed numbers
- Divide fractions using the reciprocal method
- Solve word problems involving fraction operations

---

## 1. Addition of Fractions

### Case 1: Like Fractions (Same Denominator)
```
Rule: Add numerators, keep denominator same.

a/c + b/c = (a + b)/c
```

**Examples**:
```
2/7 + 3/7 = (2 + 3)/7 = 5/7

1/5 + 2/5 + 1/5 = (1 + 2 + 1)/5 = 4/5
```

**Visual**:
```
2/7 + 3/7:

██░░░░░ + ███░░░░ = █████░░
  2/7       3/7       5/7
```

### Case 2: Unlike Fractions (Different Denominators)
```
Step 1: Find LCM of denominators
Step 2: Convert to equivalent fractions with LCM
Step 3: Add numerators
Step 4: Simplify if needed
```

**Example**: Add 2/3 + 1/4
```
Step 1: LCM(3, 4) = 12

Step 2: 2/3 = (2 × 4)/(3 × 4) = 8/12
        1/4 = (1 × 3)/(4 × 3) = 3/12

Step 3: 8/12 + 3/12 = 11/12

Answer: 2/3 + 1/4 = 11/12
```

**Visual**:
```
  2/3          1/4           11/12
████████░░░░ + ███░░░░░░░░░ = ███████████░
  8/12          3/12           11/12
```

### Case 3: Adding Mixed Numbers
```
Method 1: Add whole parts and fraction parts separately
Method 2: Convert to improper fractions first

Example: 2 1/3 + 1 3/4

Method 1:
Whole parts: 2 + 1 = 3
Fraction parts: 1/3 + 3/4 = 4/12 + 9/12 = 13/12 = 1 1/12
Total: 3 + 1 1/12 = 4 1/12

Method 2:
2 1/3 = 7/3
1 3/4 = 7/4
LCM(3, 4) = 12
7/3 = 28/12
7/4 = 21/12
28/12 + 21/12 = 49/12 = 4 1/12 ✓
```

---

## 2. Subtraction of Fractions

### Case 1: Like Fractions
```
Rule: Subtract numerators, keep denominator same.

a/c - b/c = (a - b)/c
```

**Examples**:
```
5/8 - 2/8 = (5 - 2)/8 = 3/8

7/9 - 4/9 = (7 - 4)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3
```

### Case 2: Unlike Fractions
```
Step 1: Find LCM of denominators
Step 2: Convert to equivalent fractions
Step 3: Subtract numerators
Step 4: Simplify if needed

Example: 3/4 - 1/3

LCM(4, 3) = 12
3/4 = 9/12
1/3 = 4/12
9/12 - 4/12 = 5/12

Answer: 3/4 - 1/3 = 5/12
```

### Case 3: Subtracting Mixed Numbers
```
Example: 5 1/4 - 2 2/3

Method 1 (Convert to improper fractions):
5 1/4 = 21/4
2 2/3 = 8/3

LCM(4, 3) = 12
21/4 = 63/12
8/3 = 32/12

63/12 - 32/12 = 31/12 = 2 7/12

Method 2 (Borrowing):
5 1/4 - 2 2/3

Convert fractions: 1/4 = 3/12, 2/3 = 8/12
Can't subtract 8/12 from 3/12!

Borrow 1 from 5:
5 3/12 = 4 15/12  (since 12/12 + 3/12 = 15/12)

Now: 4 15/12 - 2 8/12 = 2 7/12 ✓
```

---

## 3. Multiplication of Fractions

### Rule
```
Multiply numerators together.
Multiply denominators together.

a/b × c/d = (a × c)/(b × d)
```

### Basic Examples
```
2/3 × 4/5 = (2 × 4)/(3 × 5) = 8/15

3/4 × 2/7 = (3 × 2)/(4 × 7) = 6/28 = 3/14
```

### Visual Understanding
```
1/2 × 1/3 = ?

"One-half of one-third"

One-third of a whole:
┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
│░░░░░░░░░│         │         │
└─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘

One-half of one-third:
┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
│░░░░░    │         │         │ = 1/6 of whole
└─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘

1/2 × 1/3 = 1/6 ✓
```

### Simplifying Before Multiplying (Cross-Cancellation)
```
Cancel common factors BEFORE multiplying!

Example: 4/9 × 3/8

    4   3      1   1
   ─── × ─── = ─ × ─
    9   8      3   2
    
4 and 8 share factor 4: 4÷4=1, 8÷4=2
3 and 9 share factor 3: 3÷3=1, 9÷3=3

1/3 × 1/2 = 1/6

Much easier than: (4×3)/(9×8) = 12/72 = 1/6
```

### Multiplying Mixed Numbers
```
Rule: Convert to improper fractions first!

Example: 2 1/2 × 1 1/3

2 1/2 = 5/2
1 1/3 = 4/3

5/2 × 4/3 = 20/6 = 10/3 = 3 1/3
```

### Multiplying Whole Number by Fraction
```
Write whole number as fraction over 1.

3 × 2/5 = 3/1 × 2/5 = 6/5 = 1 1/5

5 × 3/4 = 5/1 × 3/4 = 15/4 = 3 3/4
```

---

## 4. Division of Fractions

### The Reciprocal Rule
```
To divide by a fraction, multiply by its reciprocal.

The reciprocal of a/b is b/a.

a/b ÷ c/d = a/b × d/c
```

### Why This Works
```
Dividing by 2 = Multiplying by 1/2
Dividing by 1/2 = Multiplying by 2

Example: 6 ÷ 1/2 = ?
"How many halves fit in 6?"

|===|===|===|===|===|===|
  2   2   2   2   2   2    (twelve halves)

6 ÷ 1/2 = 6 × 2 = 12 ✓
```

### Basic Examples
```
3/4 ÷ 1/2 = 3/4 × 2/1 = 6/4 = 3/2 = 1 1/2

5/6 ÷ 2/3 = 5/6 × 3/2 = 15/12 = 5/4 = 1 1/4

2/3 ÷ 4 = 2/3 × 1/4 = 2/12 = 1/6
```

### Dividing Mixed Numbers
```
Rule: Convert to improper fractions first!

Example: 3 1/2 ÷ 1 1/4

3 1/2 = 7/2
1 1/4 = 5/4

7/2 ÷ 5/4 = 7/2 × 4/5 = 28/10 = 14/5 = 2 4/5
```

### Dividing by a Whole Number
```
4/5 ÷ 2 = 4/5 × 1/2 = 4/10 = 2/5

3/4 ÷ 6 = 3/4 × 1/6 = 3/24 = 1/8
```

---

## 5. Order of Operations with Fractions

### BODMAS/PEMDAS Still Applies
```
1. Brackets first
2. Orders (exponents)
3. Division and Multiplication (left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
```

### Example 1
```
1/2 + 1/3 × 2/5

= 1/2 + (1/3 × 2/5)    [Multiply first]
= 1/2 + 2/15
= 15/30 + 4/30        [LCM(2,15) = 30]
= 19/30
```

### Example 2
```
(1/2 + 1/3) × 2/5

= (3/6 + 2/6) × 2/5    [Brackets first]
= 5/6 × 2/5
= 10/30
= 1/3
```

### Example 3
```
3/4 ÷ 1/2 + 1/3 × 3/4

= (3/4 × 2/1) + (1/3 × 3/4)   [÷ and × left to right]
= 3/2 + 3/12
= 3/2 + 1/4
= 6/4 + 1/4
= 7/4
= 1 3/4
```

## 6. Word Problems

### Type 1: Finding Part of a Whole
```
A pizza has 8 slices. You eat 3/4 of it. 
How many slices did you eat?

Solution: 3/4 of 8 = 3/4 × 8 = 24/4 = 6 slices
```

### Type 2: Finding What Fraction
```
A class has 30 students. 18 are girls.
What fraction of the class are girls?

Solution: 18/30 = 3/5 of the class
```

### Type 3: Working Backwards
```
2/3 of a number is 24. Find the number.

Solution: 
Let the number be n
2/3 × n = 24
n = 24 ÷ 2/3
n = 24 × 3/2
n = 72/2 = 36
```

### Type 4: Combined Operations
```
A rope is 12 meters long. 1/4 is cut off, 
then 2/3 of the remainder is painted.
How much is painted?

Solution:
Cut off: 1/4 × 12 = 3 meters
Remainder: 12 - 3 = 9 meters
Painted: 2/3 × 9 = 6 meters
```

### Type 5: Sharing Problems
```
3 friends share 2/3 of a cake equally.
What fraction does each get?

Solution: 2/3 ÷ 3 = 2/3 × 1/3 = 2/9 each
```

---

## 7. Solved Examples

### Example 1: Addition
```
Add: 2/5 + 3/4 + 1/10

LCM(5, 4, 10) = 20

2/5 = 8/20
3/4 = 15/20
1/10 = 2/20

8/20 + 15/20 + 2/20 = 25/20 = 5/4 = 1 1/4
```

### Example 2: Subtraction
```
Subtract: 7 1/2 - 3 3/4

7 1/2 = 15/2 = 30/4
3 3/4 = 15/4

30/4 - 15/4 = 15/4 = 3 3/4
```

### Example 3: Multiplication with Cancellation
```
Multiply: 8/15 × 5/12

Cancel first:
8 and 12: GCF=4, so 8→2, 12→3
5 and 15: GCF=5, so 5→1, 15→3

2/3 × 1/3 = 2/9
```

### Example 4: Division
```
Divide: 4 1/5 ÷ 1 2/5

4 1/5 = 21/5
1 2/5 = 7/5

21/5 ÷ 7/5 = 21/5 × 5/7 = 21/7 = 3
```

### Example 5: Complex Expression
```
Evaluate: (2/3 + 1/4) ÷ (5/6 - 1/3)

Numerator: 2/3 + 1/4 = 8/12 + 3/12 = 11/12
Denominator: 5/6 - 1/3 = 5/6 - 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2

11/12 ÷ 1/2 = 11/12 × 2/1 = 22/12 = 11/6 = 1 5/6
```

### Example 6: Word Problem
```
A tank is 2/3 full. After using 1/4 of the 
water in it, what fraction remains?

Water used: 1/4 of 2/3 = 1/4 × 2/3 = 2/12 = 1/6

Water remaining: 2/3 - 1/6 = 4/6 - 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2

The tank is now 1/2 full.
```

## 8. Mental Math Tips 🧠

### Quick Addition of Unit Fractions
```
1/a + 1/b = (a + b)/(a × b)

1/2 + 1/3 = (2 + 3)/(2 × 3) = 5/6
1/4 + 1/5 = (4 + 5)/(4 × 5) = 9/20
1/3 + 1/7 = (3 + 7)/(3 × 7) = 10/21
```

### Multiplying by 1/2 or 1/4
```
× 1/2 = ÷ 2 (halve the number)
× 1/4 = ÷ 4 (quarter the number)
× 3/4 = × 1/4 × 3 (quarter, then triple)

24 × 3/4 = 24 ÷ 4 × 3 = 6 × 3 = 18
```

### Dividing by a Fraction
```
÷ 1/2 = × 2 (double)
÷ 1/4 = × 4 (quadruple)
÷ 1/3 = × 3 (triple)
```

### When Denominators Share a Factor
```
1/6 + 1/4

6 and 4 share factor 2
LCM = 6 × 4 ÷ 2 = 12

Quick conversion:
1/6 = 2/12 (×2)
1/4 = 3/12 (×3)
Sum = 5/12
```
