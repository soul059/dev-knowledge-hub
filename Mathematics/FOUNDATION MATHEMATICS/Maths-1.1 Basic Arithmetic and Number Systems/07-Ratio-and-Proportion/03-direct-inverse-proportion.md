## 1. Direct Proportion

### Definition
```
Two quantities are in DIRECT PROPORTION if:
- When one increases, the other increases
- When one decreases, the other decreases
- The ratio between them stays CONSTANT

y ∝ x  (y is directly proportional to x)
y = kx  (where k is the constant of proportionality)
```

### Visual Representation
```
Direct Proportion: y = 2x

x:  1    2    3    4    5
y:  2    4    6    8   10

     As x increases, y increases proportionally
```

### Examples of Direct Proportion
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  DIRECT PROPORTION EXAMPLES                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  • More items → More cost                               │
│  • More hours worked → More pay                         │
│  • More distance → More petrol used                     │
│  • More people → More food needed                       │
│  • Larger area → More paint needed                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Constant Ratio
```
If x and y are directly proportional:

y₁/x₁ = y₂/x₂ = k (constant)

OR

x₁/y₁ = x₂/y₂
```

---

## 2. Solving Direct Proportion Problems

### Method 1: Using the Ratio
```
If 5 notebooks cost $20, how much do 8 notebooks cost?

Given: More notebooks → More cost (direct proportion)

Set up ratio:
Notebooks : Cost = Notebooks : Cost
5 : 20 = 8 : x

5/20 = 8/x
5x = 20 × 8
5x = 160
x = 32

8 notebooks cost $32
```

### Method 2: Finding the Constant
```
If 5 notebooks cost $20, how much do 8 notebooks cost?

Step 1: Find cost per notebook (constant)
        k = $20 ÷ 5 = $4 per notebook

Step 2: Use constant to find answer
        8 notebooks = 8 × $4 = $32
```

### Method 3: Multiplier Method
```
If 5 notebooks cost $20, how much do 8 notebooks cost?

Multiplier: 8/5 = 1.6

Cost = $20 × 1.6 = $32
```

### Worked Examples
```
Example 1: Speed and Distance
A car travels 240 km in 4 hours.
How far in 7 hours at the same speed?

Distance ∝ Time (direct proportion)
4 : 240 = 7 : x
4x = 240 × 7
x = 420 km

Example 2: Recipe Scaling
A recipe for 6 people needs 300g flour.
How much flour for 10 people?

Flour ∝ People
6 : 300 = 10 : x
6x = 3000
x = 500g
```

---

## 3. Inverse Proportion

### Definition
```
Two quantities are in INVERSE PROPORTION if:
- When one increases, the other decreases
- When one decreases, the other increases
- Their PRODUCT stays constant

y ∝ 1/x  (y is inversely proportional to x)
xy = k   (where k is the constant)
y = k/x
```

### Visual Representation
```
Inverse Proportion: xy = 12

x:  1    2    3    4    6   12
y: 12    6    4    3    2    1

└────────────────────────────→
     As x increases, y decreases (and vice versa)
```

### Examples of Inverse Proportion
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  INVERSE PROPORTION EXAMPLES                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  • More workers → Less time to complete job             │
│  • Faster speed → Less time for journey                 │
│  • Wider pipe → Less time to fill tank                  │
│  • More taps → Less time to fill container              │
│  • Higher gear → Fewer wheel rotations                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Constant Product
```
If x and y are inversely proportional:

x₁ × y₁ = x₂ × y₂ = k (constant)
```

---

## 4. Solving Inverse Proportion Problems

### Method 1: Using the Product
```
If 6 workers can complete a job in 12 days,
how long for 9 workers?

Given: More workers → Less days (inverse proportion)

6 × 12 = 9 × x
72 = 9x
x = 8 days
```

### Method 2: Finding the Constant
```
If 6 workers complete a job in 12 days,
how long for 9 workers?

Step 1: Find total worker-days (constant)
        k = 6 × 12 = 72 worker-days

Step 2: Use constant
        9 workers: 72 ÷ 9 = 8 days
```

### Method 3: Inverse Multiplier
```
If 6 workers take 12 days, how long for 9 workers?

Workers multiplied by: 9/6 = 1.5
Days divided by: 1.5

Days = 12 ÷ 1.5 = 8 days

(Or: 12 × 6/9 = 8 days)
```

### Worked Examples
```
Example 1: Speed and Time
A train traveling at 60 km/h takes 4 hours.
How long at 80 km/h?

Speed ↑ Time ↓ (inverse proportion)
60 × 4 = 80 × x
240 = 80x
x = 3 hours

Example 2: Pipes and Time
3 taps fill a tank in 8 hours.
How long with 4 taps?

Taps ↑ Time ↓ (inverse proportion)
3 × 8 = 4 × x
24 = 4x
x = 6 hours
```

---

## 5. Identifying Direct vs Inverse Proportion

### Quick Decision Chart
```
Ask: "If I DOUBLE the first quantity..."

Does the second quantity DOUBLE too?
→ YES: Direct Proportion (y = kx)

Does the second quantity HALVE?
→ YES: Inverse Proportion (xy = k)
```

### Comparison Table
```
┌────────────────┬────────────────┬────────────────┐
│                │    DIRECT      │    INVERSE     │
├────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┤
│ x doubles      │ y doubles      │ y halves       │
│ x triples      │ y triples      │ y is 1/3       │
│ x halves       │ y halves       │ y doubles      │
│ Graph          │ Straight line  │ Curved (hyp.)  │
│ Constant       │ y/x = k        │ xy = k         │
│ Formula        │ y = kx         │ y = k/x        │
└────────────────┴────────────────┴────────────────┘
```

### Identifying from Context
```
DIRECT:
• "at this rate..."
• "proportionally more/less"
• Cost per unit stays same
• Speed stays constant

INVERSE:
• "sharing work among..."
• "if speed changes, time changes"
• Total work stays constant
• Capacity stays constant
```

---

## 6. The Constant of Proportionality

### In Direct Proportion
```
y = kx, where k is the constant

Example: Distance = Speed × Time
If speed is constant at 60 km/h:
d = 60t

Here, k = 60 (the speed)
```

### In Inverse Proportion
```
xy = k, where k is the constant

Example: Workers × Days = Total work
If total work is constant at 72 worker-days:
6 workers × 12 days = 72
9 workers × 8 days = 72

Here, k = 72 (total work)
```

### Finding the Constant
```
Direct: k = y/x (from any pair of values)
        If (3, 15) is a point, k = 15/3 = 5
        So y = 5x

Inverse: k = x × y (from any pair of values)
         If (4, 6) is a point, k = 4 × 6 = 24
         So xy = 24 or y = 24/x
```

## 7. Combined Proportion Problems

### Two Variables Affecting One
```
The number of workers AND hours per day both affect
how long a job takes.

If 6 workers working 8 hours/day finish in 15 days,
how long for 10 workers working 6 hours/day?

Total work = Workers × Hours/day × Days = constant

6 × 8 × 15 = 10 × 6 × x
720 = 60x
x = 12 days
```

### Compound Proportion
```
More general formula for compound proportion:

If multiple factors are involved, multiply all
direct proportions and divide by inverse ones.

Example: Food supply for 100 soldiers for 60 days.
         How long for 150 soldiers?

Soldiers ↑ Days ↓ (inverse)
Days = 60 × (100/150) = 60 × 2/3 = 40 days
```

## 8. Real-World Applications

### Work Problems
```
If 5 workers can paint a house in 12 days,
how many workers needed to paint it in 4 days?

5 × 12 = x × 4
60 = 4x
x = 15 workers
```

### Speed-Time-Distance
```
A train at 90 km/h takes 4 hours.
At what speed to complete in 3 hours?

90 × 4 = x × 3
360 = 3x
x = 120 km/h
```

### Gear Ratios
```
A gear with 30 teeth drives a gear with 10 teeth.
If the small gear makes 90 rotations,
how many does the large gear make?

Teeth × Rotations = constant
30 × x = 10 × 90
30x = 900
x = 30 rotations

(Larger gear rotates slower)
```

### Currency Exchange
```
$50 = €45 (direct proportion)
How many euros for $80?

50 : 45 = 80 : x
50x = 45 × 80
50x = 3600
x = €72
```

---

## 9. Solved Examples

### Example 1: Direct Proportion
```
If 7 kg of rice costs $28, what is the cost of 12 kg?

Direct proportion: More rice → More cost
7 : 28 = 12 : x
7x = 28 × 12
7x = 336
x = $48
```

### Example 2: Inverse Proportion
```
A car at 60 km/h takes 5 hours to reach a destination.
How long at 75 km/h?

Inverse: Faster speed → Less time
60 × 5 = 75 × x
300 = 75x
x = 4 hours
```

### Example 3: Finding the Constant
```
y varies directly with x. When x = 4, y = 20.
Find y when x = 7.

k = y/x = 20/4 = 5
y = 5x
When x = 7: y = 5 × 7 = 35
```

### Example 4: Inverse Constant
```
y varies inversely with x. When x = 3, y = 8.
Find y when x = 6.

k = xy = 3 × 8 = 24
When x = 6: y = 24/6 = 4
```

### Example 5: Work Problem
```
8 workers can complete a project in 15 days.
After 5 days, 2 workers leave.
How many more days to complete?

Work done in 5 days: 8 × 5 = 40 worker-days
Total work: 8 × 15 = 120 worker-days
Remaining work: 120 - 40 = 80 worker-days

Remaining workers: 8 - 2 = 6 workers
Days needed: 80 ÷ 6 = 13⅓ days
```

### Example 6: Compound Problem
```
12 workers working 8 hours/day complete a job in 10 days.
How many workers for 6 hours/day in 16 days?

12 × 8 × 10 = x × 6 × 16
960 = 96x
x = 10 workers
```

## 10. Mental Math Tips 🧠

### Quick Proportion Checks
```
Direct: If x doubles, y doubles
        If ratio stays same, it's direct

Inverse: If x doubles, y halves
         If product stays same, it's inverse
```

### Scaling Shortcuts
```
Direct proportion scaling:
2 items cost $10
4 items cost $20 (×2)
8 items cost $40 (×4)

Inverse proportion scaling:
4 workers take 12 days
8 workers take 6 days (÷2)
2 workers take 24 days (×2)
```

### Product Check for Inverse
```
Quick verification:
Workers × Days = constant

6 × 12 = 72 ✓
9 × 8 = 72 ✓
12 × 6 = 72 ✓

All equal = correct answer
```

### Fraction Shortcut
```
For inverse proportion:
New value = Old value × (Old factor / New factor)

6 workers → 9 workers
Days = 12 × (6/9) = 12 × 2/3 = 8 days
```
