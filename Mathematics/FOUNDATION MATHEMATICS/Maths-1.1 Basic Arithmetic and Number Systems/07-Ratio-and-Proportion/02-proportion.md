## 1. What is Proportion?

### Definition
```
A PROPORTION is a statement that two ratios are equal.

If a : b = c : d, then a, b, c, d are in proportion.

Written as: a : b :: c : d
Read as: "a is to b as c is to d"
```

### Visual Representation
```
Proportion: 2 : 3 = 4 : 6

First ratio:    ■ ■ □ □ □     (2 shaded out of 5)

Second ratio:   ■ ■ ■ ■ □ □ □ □ □ □  (4 shaded out of 10)

Same fraction: 2/5 = 4/10 = 2/5 ✓
```

### The Proportion Statement

## 2. Testing for Proportion

### The Cross Product Rule
```
Two ratios form a proportion if:

Product of Extremes = Product of Means

a × d = b × c
```

### Example: Testing Proportions
```
Is 3 : 4 = 6 : 8 a proportion?

Product of extremes: 3 × 8 = 24
Product of means: 4 × 6 = 24

24 = 24 ✓ Yes, it's a proportion!

─────────────────────────────────────────

Is 2 : 5 = 4 : 9 a proportion?

Product of extremes: 2 × 9 = 18
Product of means: 5 × 4 = 20

18 ≠ 20 ✗ No, it's NOT a proportion!
```

### Quick Check Method
```
Method 1: Cross multiply
    3       6
   ─── = ───
    4       8
    
3 × 8 = 4 × 6
  24  =  24 ✓

Method 2: Simplify both ratios
3 : 4 already simplified
6 : 8 = 3 : 4 (divide by 2)

Both equal 3 : 4 ✓
```

---

## 3. Solving Proportions

### Finding a Missing Term
```
When one term is unknown, use cross multiplication.

Example: Find x if 4 : 5 = x : 15

Cross multiply:
5 × x = 4 × 15
5x = 60
x = 60 ÷ 5
x = 12

Check: 4 : 5 = 12 : 15 → 4×15 = 5×12 → 60 = 60 ✓
```

### Position of Unknown
```
Position 1:     x : 6 = 10 : 15
                x × 15 = 6 × 10
                15x = 60
                x = 4

Position 2:     4 : x = 12 : 15
                4 × 15 = x × 12
                60 = 12x
                x = 5

Position 3:     4 : 6 = x : 15
                6 × x = 4 × 15
                6x = 60
                x = 10

Position 4:     4 : 6 = 10 : x
                4 × x = 6 × 10
                4x = 60
                x = 15
```

## 4. Properties of Proportion

### Property 1: Invertendo
```
If a : b = c : d, then b : a = d : c

Example: If 2 : 3 = 4 : 6
Then: 3 : 2 = 6 : 4

(Invert both ratios)
```

### Property 2: Alternendo
```
If a : b = c : d, then a : c = b : d

Example: If 2 : 3 = 4 : 6
Then: 2 : 4 = 3 : 6 (which is 1 : 2 = 1 : 2)

(Switch the means)
```

### Property 3: Componendo
```
If a : b = c : d, then (a + b) : b = (c + d) : d

Example: If 3 : 4 = 6 : 8
Then: (3+4) : 4 = (6+8) : 8
      7 : 4 = 14 : 8 ✓
```

### Property 4: Dividendo
```
If a : b = c : d, then (a - b) : b = (c - d) : d

Example: If 5 : 3 = 10 : 6
Then: (5-3) : 3 = (10-6) : 6
      2 : 3 = 4 : 6 ✓
```

## 5. The Unitary Method

### Concept
```
The UNITARY METHOD finds the value of ONE unit first,
then uses it to find the required value.

Step 1: Find value of 1 unit
Step 2: Multiply to find required value
```

### Example 1: Direct Relationship
```
5 pens cost $15. What is the cost of 8 pens?

Step 1: Cost of 1 pen
        1 pen = $15 ÷ 5 = $3

Step 2: Cost of 8 pens
        8 pens = 8 × $3 = $24
```

### Example 2: Working Backwards
```
If 12 workers can complete a job in 8 days,
how many days for 16 workers?

Step 1: Days for 1 worker
        1 worker = 12 × 8 = 96 days

Step 2: Days for 16 workers
        16 workers = 96 ÷ 16 = 6 days

(Note: More workers = fewer days = inverse relationship)
```

### Visual Unitary Method
```
3 shirts cost $45

    3 shirts ─────→ $45
              ÷3 ↓   ↓ ÷3
    1 shirt  ─────→ $15
              ×7 ↓   ↓ ×7
    7 shirts ─────→ $105
```

## 6. Mean Proportional

### Definition
```
If a : x = x : b, then x is the MEAN PROPORTIONAL
(or geometric mean) between a and b.

x² = a × b
x = √(a × b)
```

### Example
```
Find the mean proportional between 4 and 16.

x² = 4 × 16 = 64
x = √64 = 8

Check: 4 : 8 = 8 : 16
       (both equal 1 : 2) ✓
```

### Third Proportional
```
If a : b = b : c, then c is the THIRD PROPORTIONAL
to a and b.

c = b²/a

Example: Find third proportional to 4 and 6.
4 : 6 = 6 : c
c = 6²/4 = 36/4 = 9

Check: 4 : 6 = 6 : 9 (both = 2 : 3) ✓
```

### Fourth Proportional
```
If a : b = c : d, then d is the FOURTH PROPORTIONAL.

d = (b × c)/a

Example: Find fourth proportional to 2, 3, and 4.
2 : 3 = 4 : d
d = (3 × 4)/2 = 12/2 = 6

Check: 2 : 3 = 4 : 6 (both = 2 : 3) ✓
```

---

## 7. Continued Proportion

### Definition
```
Quantities are in CONTINUED PROPORTION when:
a : b = b : c = c : d = ...

Each term (except first and last) is both a mean and an extreme.
```

### Example
```
2, 4, 8, 16 are in continued proportion:

2 : 4 = 4 : 8 = 8 : 16

All equal 1 : 2

This is a geometric sequence with common ratio 2.
```

### Finding Missing Terms
```
If 3, x, 12 are in continued proportion, find x.

3 : x = x : 12
x² = 3 × 12 = 36
x = 6

Check: 3 : 6 = 6 : 12 (both = 1 : 2) ✓
```

---

## 8. Word Problems with Proportion

### Direct Proportion Problems
```
If 6 books cost $42, how much do 10 books cost?

Set up proportion:
Books : Cost = Books : Cost
6 : 42 = 10 : x

Cross multiply:
6x = 42 × 10
6x = 420
x = 70

10 books cost $70
```

### Map Scale Problems
```
On a map, 2 cm represents 5 km.
What distance does 7 cm represent?

2 : 5 = 7 : x
2x = 5 × 7
2x = 35
x = 17.5 km
```

### Recipe Scaling
```
A recipe for 4 people needs 6 eggs.
How many eggs for 10 people?

4 : 6 = 10 : x
4x = 6 × 10
4x = 60
x = 15 eggs
```

### Speed-Time-Distance
```
A car travels 180 km in 3 hours.
How far will it travel in 5 hours at the same speed?

3 : 180 = 5 : x
3x = 180 × 5
3x = 900
x = 300 km
```

## 9. Solved Examples

### Example 1: Testing Proportion
```
Check if 15, 20, 21, 28 are in proportion.

15 : 20 :: 21 : 28?

Product of extremes: 15 × 28 = 420
Product of means: 20 × 21 = 420

420 = 420 ✓ Yes, they are in proportion.
```

### Example 2: Find Missing Term
```
Find x if 12 : 18 = 8 : x

12 × x = 18 × 8
12x = 144
x = 12
```

### Example 3: Mean Proportional
```
Find mean proportional between 3 and 27.

x² = 3 × 27 = 81
x = √81 = 9

Check: 3 : 9 = 9 : 27 (both = 1 : 3) ✓
```

### Example 4: Third Proportional
```
Find third proportional to 8 and 12.

8 : 12 = 12 : x
8x = 12 × 12
8x = 144
x = 18

Check: 8 : 12 = 12 : 18 (both = 2 : 3) ✓
```

### Example 5: Word Problem
```
A car uses 12 liters of petrol for 180 km.
How much petrol for 300 km?

12 : 180 = x : 300
180x = 12 × 300
180x = 3600
x = 20 liters
```

### Example 6: Compound Proportion
```
If 8 workers can build a wall in 15 days,
how long for 12 workers?

Workers × Days = Constant (inverse proportion)

8 × 15 = 12 × x
120 = 12x
x = 10 days
```

---

## 10. Mental Math Tips 🧠

### Quick Cross Multiplication
```
For a : b = c : x

x = (b × c) / a

Example: 3 : 5 = 6 : x
x = (5 × 6) / 3 = 30/3 = 10
```

### Scaling Factor Method
```
If 4 : 7 = 12 : x

Look at how first terms relate:
12 ÷ 4 = 3 (scaling factor)

Apply same factor to second term:
x = 7 × 3 = 21
```

### Proportional Shortcuts
```
Double one, double the other:
2 : 3 = 4 : 6 = 8 : 12

If you know 4 × 5 = 20,
then 4 : 5 = 20 : 25 (multiply both by 5)
and 4 : 5 = 8 : 10 (multiply both by 2)
```

### Mean Proportional Estimate
```
Mean proportional of perfect squares:
√(4 × 16) = √64 = 8
√(9 × 25) = √225 = 15
√(1 × 100) = √100 = 10
```
