## 1. Map Scales and Distances

### Understanding Scale
```
A map scale tells how distances on the map
relate to actual distances.

Scale 1 : 50,000 means:
1 cm on map = 50,000 cm in reality
1 cm on map = 500 m in reality
1 cm on map = 0.5 km in reality
```

### Types of Scale Representation
```
1. Ratio form:     1 : 25,000
2. Statement:      1 cm represents 250 m
3. Linear scale:   |──|──|──|──|
                   0  1  2  3  km
```

### Calculating Real Distance
```
Map scale: 1 : 200,000
Distance on map: 4.5 cm
Actual distance: ?

Actual = Map distance × Scale factor
       = 4.5 × 200,000 cm
       = 900,000 cm
       = 9 km
```

### Calculating Map Distance
```
Map scale: 1 : 50,000
Actual distance: 8 km
Map distance: ?

Map = Actual ÷ Scale factor
    = 8 km ÷ 50,000
    = 8,000 m ÷ 50,000
    = 800,000 cm ÷ 50,000
    = 16 cm
```

### Worked Example
```
On a map with scale 1 : 250,000:
a) Town A and B are 6 cm apart on map.
   What is the actual distance?

   Actual = 6 × 250,000 = 1,500,000 cm
          = 15 km

b) Town C is 25 km from Town B.
   What is the map distance?

   Map = 25 km ÷ 250,000
       = 2,500,000 cm ÷ 250,000
       = 10 cm
```

---

## 2. Similar Figures

### What Are Similar Figures?
```
Similar figures have:
• Same shape
• Proportional corresponding sides
• Equal corresponding angles

Scale factor = Ratio of corresponding sides
```

### Finding Missing Sides
```
Triangle ABC ~ Triangle DEF (similar)

    A                D
   /\              /\
  /  \            /  \
 /    \          /    \
B──────C        E──────F

AB = 6, BC = 8, AC = 10
DE = 9, EF = ?, DF = ?

Scale factor = DE/AB = 9/6 = 3/2

EF = BC × 3/2 = 8 × 3/2 = 12
DF = AC × 3/2 = 10 × 3/2 = 15
```

### Area and Volume Ratios
```
If linear ratio = k : 1

Area ratio = k² : 1
Volume ratio = k³ : 1

Example: If sides are in ratio 2 : 3
         Areas are in ratio 4 : 9
         Volumes are in ratio 8 : 27
```

---

## 3. Mixtures and Alligation

### Simple Mixtures
```
Mixing quantities in a given ratio:

Mix 2 liters of A with 3 liters of B

Total mixture = 2 + 3 = 5 liters
A is 2/5 of mixture (40%)
B is 3/5 of mixture (60%)
```

### Concentration Problems
```
A 20% salt solution and 50% salt solution are mixed
in ratio 2 : 1. Find concentration of mixture.

Method: Weighted average
Concentration = (2 × 20% + 1 × 50%) / (2 + 1)
              = (40% + 50%) / 3
              = 90% / 3
              = 30%
```

### Alligation Rule
```
Finding the ratio for mixing two items at different prices
to get a mixture at a desired price.

### Alligation Example
```
Mix tea at $8/kg with tea at $12/kg
to get mixture at $9/kg.
In what ratio should they be mixed?

Tea A: $8         Tea B: $12
    \               /
     \    $9       /
      \           /
    |12-9| : |9-8|
       3   :   1

Mix in ratio 3 : 1 (A : B)

Check: (3×8 + 1×12)/(3+1) = (24+12)/4 = $9 ✓
```

---

## 4. Partnership and Profit Sharing

### Equal Time Partnership
```
When partners invest for the SAME time period:

Profit shared in ratio of investments

A invests $3,000 and B invests $5,000 for 1 year.
Profit = $4,000

A's share : B's share = 3000 : 5000 = 3 : 5

Total parts = 8
A gets: 3/8 × $4,000 = $1,500
B gets: 5/8 × $4,000 = $2,500
```

### Different Time Partnership
```
When partners invest for DIFFERENT time periods:

Use: Investment × Time

A invests $6,000 for 8 months
B invests $4,000 for 12 months

A's contribution = 6000 × 8 = 48,000
B's contribution = 4000 × 12 = 48,000

Ratio = 48,000 : 48,000 = 1 : 1

They share profit equally!
```

### Complex Partnership Example
```
A starts with $10,000
After 4 months, B joins with $15,000
Total profit after 12 months: $5,400

A's contribution = 10,000 × 12 = 120,000
B's contribution = 15,000 × 8 = 120,000

Ratio = 120,000 : 120,000 = 1 : 1

A gets: $5,400 ÷ 2 = $2,700
B gets: $5,400 ÷ 2 = $2,700
```

---

## 5. Time and Work Problems

### Basic Work Rate
```
If A can complete work in 10 days:
A's rate = 1/10 of work per day

If B can complete work in 15 days:
B's rate = 1/15 of work per day

Together per day = 1/10 + 1/15 = 3/30 + 2/30 = 5/30 = 1/6

Together they finish in 6 days
```

### Work Distribution
```
A and B can do a job in 12 days.
A alone takes 20 days.
How long for B alone?

Together: 1/12 per day
A alone: 1/20 per day

B's rate = 1/12 - 1/20
         = 5/60 - 3/60
         = 2/60 = 1/30

B alone takes 30 days
```

### Work-Wage Problems
```
If work is shared in ratio of work done:

A does 2/5 of work
B does 3/5 of work
Total wage: $250

A's wage = 2/5 × $250 = $100
B's wage = 3/5 × $250 = $150
```

## 6. Speed, Distance, and Time

### Basic Relationship
```
Distance = Speed × Time

D = S × T
S = D / T
T = D / S
```

### Average Speed
```
Average speed ≠ Simple average of speeds

For equal distances at speeds s₁ and s₂:

Average speed = 2s₁s₂/(s₁ + s₂)

Example: 60 km at 30 km/h, then 60 km at 60 km/h

Average = 2 × 30 × 60/(30 + 60)
        = 3600/90
        = 40 km/h

NOT (30+60)/2 = 45 km/h!
```

### Relative Speed
```
Same direction: Relative speed = |s₁ - s₂|
Opposite direction: Relative speed = s₁ + s₂

Example: Two trains at 60 km/h and 40 km/h

Same direction: 60 - 40 = 20 km/h
Opposite: 60 + 40 = 100 km/h
```

## 7. Pipes and Cisterns

### Filling and Emptying
```
Pipe A fills a tank in 6 hours: Rate = 1/6 per hour
Pipe B fills a tank in 8 hours: Rate = 1/8 per hour
Pipe C empties in 12 hours: Rate = -1/12 per hour

All together:
Net rate = 1/6 + 1/8 - 1/12
         = 4/24 + 3/24 - 2/24
         = 5/24 per hour

Time to fill = 24/5 = 4.8 hours
```

### Partial Filling
```
A can fill in 10 hours, B can fill in 15 hours.
A works for 2 hours, then B joins.
How long to fill completely?

Work done by A in 2 hours = 2/10 = 1/5
Remaining work = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5

Together: 1/10 + 1/15 = 5/30 = 1/6 per hour

Time for 4/5 work = (4/5) ÷ (1/6) = 4/5 × 6 = 24/5 hours

Total time = 2 + 24/5 = 34/5 = 6.8 hours
```

---

## 8. Recipe and Mixture Scaling

### Scaling Up Recipes
```
Recipe for 4 people:
• 2 cups flour
• 1 cup sugar
• 3 eggs

For 10 people (scale factor = 10/4 = 2.5):
• 2 × 2.5 = 5 cups flour
• 1 × 2.5 = 2.5 cups sugar
• 3 × 2.5 = 7.5 eggs (round to 8)
```

### Concentration Dilution
```
How much water to add to 500 ml of 20% juice
to make it 10% juice?

Juice amount = 500 × 0.20 = 100 ml
Let water added = x ml

10% of (500 + x) = 100 ml
0.10 × (500 + x) = 100
500 + x = 1000
x = 500 ml water needed
```

---

## 9. Solved Examples

### Example 1: Map Scale
```
Scale 1 : 400,000. Two cities are 15 km apart.
What's the map distance?

15 km = 1,500,000 cm
Map distance = 1,500,000 ÷ 400,000 = 3.75 cm
```

### Example 2: Mixture
```
Milk at $4/L and water (free) mixed to get
20 liters at $3/L. How much of each?

Let milk = x liters, water = (20-x) liters

4x + 0(20-x) = 3 × 20
4x = 60
x = 15 liters milk

Water = 20 - 15 = 5 liters
```

### Example 3: Partnership
```
P invests $8,000 for 6 months
Q invests $6,000 for 8 months
R invests $10,000 for 4 months
Profit = $5,100

P : Q : R = (8000×6) : (6000×8) : (10000×4)
          = 48,000 : 48,000 : 40,000
          = 6 : 6 : 5

Total parts = 17

P gets: 6/17 × 5100 = $1,800
Q gets: 6/17 × 5100 = $1,800
R gets: 5/17 × 5100 = $1,500
```

### Example 4: Work Problem
```
A can do a job in 12 days, B in 15 days, C in 20 days.
How long if all work together?

Rates: 1/12 + 1/15 + 1/20

LCM of 12, 15, 20 = 60

= 5/60 + 4/60 + 3/60 = 12/60 = 1/5

Together: 5 days
```

### Example 5: Pipes
```
A fills in 12 hours, B empties in 18 hours.
Starting empty, how long with both open?

Net rate = 1/12 - 1/18 = 3/36 - 2/36 = 1/36

Time to fill = 36 hours
```

## 10. Mental Math Tips 🧠

### Scale Conversion Tricks
```
1 km = 100,000 cm
1 m = 100 cm

Scale 1:100,000 means 1 cm = 1 km
Scale 1:50,000 means 2 cm = 1 km
Scale 1:25,000 means 4 cm = 1 km
```

### Work Rate Shortcut
```
If A takes 'a' days and B takes 'b' days:
Together = (a × b)/(a + b) days

A: 6 days, B: 3 days
Together = (6 × 3)/(6 + 3) = 18/9 = 2 days
```

### Alligation Shortcut
```
For mixing at prices p₁ and p₂ to get price m:
Ratio = (p₂ - m) : (m - p₁)

$10 and $15 to get $12:
Ratio = (15-12) : (12-10) = 3 : 2
```

### Partnership Quick Calc
```
Investment × Time gives the ratio

Equal investment, equal time → equal share
Double investment, same time → double share
Same investment, double time → double share
```
