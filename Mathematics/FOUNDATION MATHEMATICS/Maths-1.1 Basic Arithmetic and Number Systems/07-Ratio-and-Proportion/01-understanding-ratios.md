- Write and simplify ratios
- Compare quantities using ratios
- Convert between different ratio forms

---

## 1. What is a Ratio?

### Definition
```
A RATIO compares two or more quantities of the same kind.

It tells us "how many times" one quantity contains another,
or what "share" each quantity has of the total.
```

### Real-World Examples
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                         │
│  Recipe: 2 cups flour to 1 cup sugar                    │
│          Ratio = 2 : 1                                  │
│                                                         │
│  Map scale: 1 cm represents 10 km                       │
│             Ratio = 1 : 1,000,000                       │
│                                                         │
│  Class: 15 boys to 12 girls                             │
│         Ratio = 15 : 12 = 5 : 4                         │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Visual Representation
```
Ratio 3 : 2 (Red to Blue)

■ ■ ■ □ □     (3 red, 2 blue)

For every 3 red, there are 2 blue.
Total parts = 3 + 2 = 5 parts
```

---

## 2. Writing Ratios

### Three Ways to Write a Ratio
```
Comparing 3 to 4:

1. Colon notation:    3 : 4
2. Fraction form:     3/4
3. Word form:         3 to 4

All three mean the same thing!
```

### Order Matters!
```
The order in which you write a ratio is IMPORTANT.

Boys to Girls = 5 : 3
Girls to Boys = 3 : 5

These are DIFFERENT ratios!
```

### Examples
```
In a bag with 8 red and 6 blue marbles:

Red to Blue = 8 : 6 = 4 : 3
Blue to Red = 6 : 8 = 3 : 4
Red to Total = 8 : 14 = 4 : 7
Blue to Total = 6 : 14 = 3 : 7
```

---

## 3. Simplifying Ratios

### The Process
```
Divide all parts of the ratio by their HCF (Highest Common Factor)

Example: Simplify 24 : 36

Step 1: Find HCF of 24 and 36
        Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
        Factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36
        HCF = 12

Step 2: Divide both by HCF
        24 ÷ 12 : 36 ÷ 12 = 2 : 3

Simplified ratio: 2 : 3
```

### More Examples
```
15 : 25 = (15÷5) : (25÷5) = 3 : 5

48 : 64 = (48÷16) : (64÷16) = 3 : 4

100 : 150 = (100÷50) : (150÷50) = 2 : 3

18 : 24 : 30 = (18÷6) : (24÷6) : (30÷6) = 3 : 4 : 5
```

### Ratios with Decimals
```
Simplify 0.5 : 2

Step 1: Remove decimals by multiplying by power of 10
        0.5 × 10 : 2 × 10 = 5 : 20

Step 2: Simplify
        5 : 20 = 1 : 4
```

### Ratios with Fractions
```
Simplify 1/2 : 3/4

Step 1: Find LCD of denominators (LCD = 4)
        1/2 = 2/4

Step 2: Express ratio with same denominator
        2/4 : 3/4

Step 3: Remove denominators (multiply by LCD)
        2 : 3
```

---

## 4. Equivalent Ratios

### Understanding Equivalence
```
Equivalent ratios represent the same relationship.

2 : 3 = 4 : 6 = 6 : 9 = 8 : 12 = 10 : 15 ...

Multiply or divide both parts by the same number.
```

### Visual Proof
```
2 : 3 shown as:
■ ■ □ □ □

4 : 6 shown as:
■ ■ ■ ■ □ □ □ □ □ □

6 : 9 shown as:
■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □

Same proportion of filled to empty!
```

### Finding Equivalent Ratios
```
Given ratio 3 : 5, find equivalent with first term = 12

3 : 5
↓ ×4
12 : ?

12 : 20 (multiply both by 4)

───────────────────────────────────

Given ratio 8 : 12, find equivalent with second term = 3

8 : 12
↓ ÷4
? : 3

2 : 3 (divide both by 4)
```

---

## 5. Part-to-Part vs Part-to-Whole

### Part-to-Part Ratio
```
Compares one part to another part.

In a class: 12 boys and 18 girls

Boys to Girls = 12 : 18 = 2 : 3
Girls to Boys = 18 : 12 = 3 : 2
```

### Part-to-Whole Ratio
```
Compares one part to the total.

Total students = 12 + 18 = 30

Boys to Total = 12 : 30 = 2 : 5
Girls to Total = 18 : 30 = 3 : 5
```

### Converting Between Them
```
If Boys : Girls = 2 : 3

Total parts = 2 + 3 = 5

Boys : Total = 2 : 5
Girls : Total = 3 : 5

Also means:
Boys = 2/5 of class
Girls = 3/5 of class
```

---

## 6. Ratios and Fractions

### Connection
```
Ratio a : b can be expressed as:
- Fraction: a/b
- Fraction of whole: a/(a+b) and b/(a+b)
```

### Example
```
Ratio of cats to dogs = 3 : 5

As a fraction: 3/5 (cats per dogs)

Total parts = 3 + 5 = 8

Cats are 3/8 of the total
Dogs are 5/8 of the total
```

### Using Ratios to Find Amounts
```
$400 is divided in ratio 3 : 5

Total parts = 3 + 5 = 8
Value of 1 part = $400 ÷ 8 = $50

First share = 3 × $50 = $150
Second share = 5 × $50 = $250

Check: $150 + $250 = $400 ✓
```

---

## 7. Comparing Ratios

### Method 1: Convert to Same Denominator
```
Which is larger: 2 : 3 or 5 : 7?

Write as fractions: 2/3 and 5/7

Find common denominator (21):
2/3 = 14/21
5/7 = 15/21

15/21 > 14/21, so 5 : 7 > 2 : 3
```

### Method 2: Cross Multiplication
```
Compare 3 : 4 and 5 : 7

Cross multiply:
3 × 7 = 21
4 × 5 = 20

21 > 20, so 3 : 4 > 5 : 7
```

### Method 3: Convert to Decimals
```
Compare 4 : 5 and 7 : 9

4/5 = 0.8
7/9 = 0.777...

0.8 > 0.777..., so 4 : 5 > 7 : 9
```

---

## 8. Ratios with Three or More Terms

### Writing Three-Term Ratios
```
A recipe needs:
3 cups flour
2 cups sugar
1 cup butter

Ratio = Flour : Sugar : Butter = 3 : 2 : 1
```

### Simplifying Three-Term Ratios
```
Simplify 15 : 25 : 35

HCF of 15, 25, 35 = 5

15÷5 : 25÷5 : 35÷5 = 3 : 5 : 7
```

### Dividing in Three Parts
```
Divide $1,200 in ratio 2 : 3 : 5

Total parts = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10
Value of 1 part = $1,200 ÷ 10 = $120

First share = 2 × $120 = $240
Second share = 3 × $120 = $360
Third share = 5 × $120 = $600

Check: $240 + $360 + $600 = $1,200 ✓
```

---

## 9. Ratios with Different Units

### Converting to Same Units First
```
Compare 50 cm to 2 m

Convert to same unit:
2 m = 200 cm

Ratio = 50 : 200 = 1 : 4
```

### Examples
```
30 minutes to 2 hours:
2 hours = 120 minutes
Ratio = 30 : 120 = 1 : 4

500 g to 2 kg:
2 kg = 2000 g
Ratio = 500 : 2000 = 1 : 4

Rs 50 to Rs 2.50:
Ratio = 5000 paise : 250 paise = 20 : 1
```

---

## 10. Solved Examples

### Example 1: Simplify Ratio
```
Simplify 144 : 180

HCF of 144 and 180:
144 = 2⁴ × 3²
180 = 2² × 3² × 5
HCF = 2² × 3² = 36

144 : 180 = (144÷36) : (180÷36) = 4 : 5
```

### Example 2: Find Missing Term
```
If 4 : 7 = x : 35, find x.

7 × 5 = 35, so multiply first term by 5 too
x = 4 × 5 = 20

Verify: 4 : 7 = 20 : 35 ✓
```

### Example 3: Divide in Given Ratio
```
Divide 72 in ratio 4 : 5

Total parts = 9
One part = 72 ÷ 9 = 8

First number = 4 × 8 = 32
Second number = 5 × 8 = 40
```

### Example 4: Age Problem
```
The ratio of John's age to Mary's age is 3 : 5.
If Mary is 20 years old, how old is John?

3 : 5 = John : Mary = John : 20

If 5 parts = 20, then 1 part = 4
John = 3 × 4 = 12 years old
```

### Example 5: Recipe Scaling
```
A recipe uses flour and sugar in ratio 5 : 2.
If 750g flour is used, how much sugar is needed?

5 : 2 = 750 : x

1 part = 750 ÷ 5 = 150g
Sugar = 2 × 150 = 300g
```

### Example 6: Combining Ratios
```
In a school, Boys : Girls = 3 : 4 and
           Girls : Teachers = 8 : 1

Find Boys : Girls : Teachers

First, make Girls the same in both ratios:
Girls = 4 in first, 8 in second
Multiply first ratio by 2: 6 : 8

Now: Boys : Girls = 6 : 8
     Girls : Teachers = 8 : 1

Combined: Boys : Girls : Teachers = 6 : 8 : 1
```

## 11. Mental Math Tips 🧠

### Quick Simplification
```
Look for common factors:
- If both end in 0: divide by 10
- If both are even: divide by 2
- If both end in 5 or 0: divide by 5

60 : 80 → 6 : 8 → 3 : 4
```

### Ratio to Percentage
```
In ratio a : b:
First part = a/(a+b) × 100%
Second part = b/(a+b) × 100%

3 : 2 means:
3/5 = 60% and 2/5 = 40%
```

### Quick Division Check
```
When dividing amount by ratio sum:

For ratio 2 : 3, dividing $100:
Total parts = 5
Each part = $20
Shares: $40 and $60
```
