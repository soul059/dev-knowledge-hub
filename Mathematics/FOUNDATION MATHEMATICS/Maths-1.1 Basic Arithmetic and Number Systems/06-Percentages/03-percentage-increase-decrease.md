## 1. Understanding Percentage Change

### What is Percentage Change?
```
Percentage change measures how much a value has
increased or decreased relative to its original value.

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

### Visual Representation
```
Original value: ████████████████████ (100%)

INCREASE of 25%:
████████████████████████████ (125%)
                    ++++++++ (added 25%)

DECREASE of 25%:
███████████████ (75%)
               ───── (removed 25%)
```

---

## 2. Calculating Percentage Increase

### Formula
```
Percentage Increase = (Increase ÷ Original) × 100

OR

Percentage Increase = ((New - Original) ÷ Original) × 100
```

### Step-by-Step Method
```
Price went from $80 to $100. Find percentage increase.

Step 1: Find the increase
        Increase = $100 - $80 = $20

Step 2: Divide by original value
        $20 ÷ $80 = 0.25

Step 3: Convert to percentage
        0.25 × 100 = 25%

Answer: 25% increase
```

### Worked Examples
```
Example 1: Population grew from 5,000 to 6,500

Increase = 6,500 - 5,000 = 1,500
Percentage = (1,500 ÷ 5,000) × 100
           = 0.30 × 100 = 30% increase

Example 2: Weight went from 60 kg to 72 kg

Increase = 72 - 60 = 12 kg
Percentage = (12 ÷ 60) × 100
           = 0.20 × 100 = 20% increase

Example 3: Score improved from 45 to 54

Increase = 54 - 45 = 9
Percentage = (9 ÷ 45) × 100
           = 0.20 × 100 = 20% increase
```

---

## 3. Calculating Percentage Decrease

### Formula
```
Percentage Decrease = (Decrease ÷ Original) × 100

OR

Percentage Decrease = ((Original - New) ÷ Original) × 100
```

### Step-by-Step Method
```
Price went from $150 to $120. Find percentage decrease.

Step 1: Find the decrease
        Decrease = $150 - $120 = $30

Step 2: Divide by original value
        $30 ÷ $150 = 0.20

Step 3: Convert to percentage
        0.20 × 100 = 20%

Answer: 20% decrease
```

### Worked Examples
```
Example 1: Temperature dropped from 25°C to 20°C

Decrease = 25 - 20 = 5
Percentage = (5 ÷ 25) × 100
           = 0.20 × 100 = 20% decrease

Example 2: Sales fell from 400 units to 340 units

Decrease = 400 - 340 = 60
Percentage = (60 ÷ 400) × 100
           = 0.15 × 100 = 15% decrease

Example 3: Discount reduced price from $80 to $68

Decrease = 80 - 68 = 12
Percentage = (12 ÷ 80) × 100
           = 0.15 × 100 = 15% decrease
```

---

## 4. Finding New Values After Percentage Change

### After Increase
```
New Value = Original × (1 + Percentage/100)

OR

New Value = Original + (Original × Percentage/100)
```

### After Decrease
```
New Value = Original × (1 - Percentage/100)

OR

New Value = Original - (Original × Percentage/100)
```

### Multiplier Method
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                   MULTIPLIERS                          ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  Increase of 20%  →  Multiply by 1.20                 ║
║  Increase of 35%  →  Multiply by 1.35                 ║
║  Increase of 5%   →  Multiply by 1.05                 ║
║  Increase of 100% →  Multiply by 2.00                 ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  Decrease of 20%  →  Multiply by 0.80                 ║
║  Decrease of 35%  →  Multiply by 0.65                 ║
║  Decrease of 5%   →  Multiply by 0.95                 ║
║  Decrease of 50%  →  Multiply by 0.50                 ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Examples Using Multipliers
```
Example 1: Increase $200 by 15%

Multiplier = 1 + 0.15 = 1.15
New value = $200 × 1.15 = $230

Example 2: Decrease 80 by 25%

Multiplier = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75
New value = 80 × 0.75 = 60

Example 3: Increase 450 by 8%

Multiplier = 1 + 0.08 = 1.08
New value = 450 × 1.08 = 486
```

---

## 5. Reverse Percentages

### The Concept
```
Finding the ORIGINAL value when you know:
- The new value, AND
- The percentage change

This is called "Reverse Percentage"
```

### Finding Original After Increase
```
Formula: Original = New Value ÷ (1 + Percentage/100)

Example: After a 20% increase, the price is $72.
         What was the original price?

$72 represents 120% (100% + 20%)
Original = $72 ÷ 1.20 = $60

Check: $60 × 1.20 = $72 ✓
```

### Finding Original After Decrease
```
Formula: Original = New Value ÷ (1 - Percentage/100)

Example: After a 25% decrease, the price is $45.
         What was the original price?

$45 represents 75% (100% - 25%)
Original = $45 ÷ 0.75 = $60

Check: $60 × 0.75 = $45 ✓
```

### Common Mistake to Avoid
```
❌ WRONG approach:
   After 20% increase, price is $72.
   Original = $72 - 20% of $72
            = $72 - $14.40 = $57.60  ← WRONG!

✓ CORRECT approach:
   Original = $72 ÷ 1.20 = $60  ← CORRECT!

The percentage applies to the ORIGINAL, not the new value!
```

---

## 6. Successive Percentage Changes

### Multiple Changes
```
When multiple percentage changes occur one after another,
multiply the multipliers together.

Final Value = Original × Multiplier₁ × Multiplier₂ × ...
```

### Example: Two Increases
```
A price increases by 10%, then by 20%.
Original price: $100

Step 1: First increase (10%)
        $100 × 1.10 = $110

Step 2: Second increase (20%)
        $110 × 1.20 = $132

Final: $132

OR in one step:
$100 × 1.10 × 1.20 = $100 × 1.32 = $132

Total increase = 32% (not 30%!)
```

### Example: Increase then Decrease
```
A value increases by 20%, then decreases by 20%.
Original: 100

Increase: 100 × 1.20 = 120
Decrease: 120 × 0.80 = 96

Final: 96

Important: 20% up then 20% down ≠ back to original!
Net change = 4% decrease
```

### Why Successive Changes Aren't Additive
```
Visual explanation:

Original: ████████████████████ = 100

+20%:     ████████████████████████ = 120
                              ████ = +20

-20% of NEW value:
          ████████████████████████ = 120
          ───────────────────────── = -24 (20% of 120)
          
Result:   ████████████████████ = 96 (not 100!)

The second percentage is calculated on a different base!
```

---

## 7. Finding Overall Percentage Change

### Formula for Two Changes
```
If change 1 = a% and change 2 = b%, then:

Overall multiplier = (1 ± a/100) × (1 ± b/100)

Overall % change = (Overall multiplier - 1) × 100
```

### Example Calculation
```
Find overall change: +30% then -20%

Multipliers: 1.30 × 0.80 = 1.04

Overall change = (1.04 - 1) × 100 = 4% increase
```

### Common Scenarios
```
+10% then -10%: 1.10 × 0.90 = 0.99 → 1% decrease
+20% then -20%: 1.20 × 0.80 = 0.96 → 4% decrease
+25% then -25%: 1.25 × 0.75 = 0.9375 → 6.25% decrease
+50% then -50%: 1.50 × 0.50 = 0.75 → 25% decrease

Pattern: Same % up then down always results in decrease!
```

## 8. Real-World Applications

### Profit and Loss
```
Cost price: $80
Selling price: $100

Profit = $100 - $80 = $20

Profit % = (Profit ÷ Cost Price) × 100
         = (20 ÷ 80) × 100
         = 25%

─────────────────────────────────────────

Cost price: $150
Selling price: $120

Loss = $150 - $120 = $30

Loss % = (Loss ÷ Cost Price) × 100
       = (30 ÷ 150) × 100
       = 20%
```

### Inflation
```
If inflation is 3% per year:

Year 0: $100
Year 1: $100 × 1.03 = $103
Year 2: $103 × 1.03 = $106.09
Year 3: $106.09 × 1.03 = $109.27

After 3 years at 3% inflation:
$100 → $109.27 (about 9.27% total increase)
```

### Population Change
```
City population: 50,000
Annual growth rate: 4%

After 2 years: 50,000 × 1.04 × 1.04
             = 50,000 × 1.0816
             = 54,080 people
```

### Compound Interest Preview
```
Principal: $1,000
Interest rate: 5% per year

After 3 years:
$1,000 × 1.05 × 1.05 × 1.05
= $1,000 × 1.157625
= $1,157.63
```

## 9. Solved Examples

### Example 1: Calculate Percentage Increase
```
A company's revenue grew from $2.5 million to $3.2 million.
Find the percentage increase.

Increase = $3.2M - $2.5M = $0.7M
% Increase = (0.7 ÷ 2.5) × 100 = 28%
```

### Example 2: Apply Percentage Decrease
```
A car worth $24,000 depreciates by 15% in the first year.
What is it worth after one year?

Multiplier = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
New value = $24,000 × 0.85 = $20,400
```

### Example 3: Reverse Percentage
```
After a 12% increase, a worker's salary is $56,000.
What was the original salary?

Original = $56,000 ÷ 1.12 = $50,000
```

### Example 4: Successive Changes
```
A stock goes up 40%, then down 30%.
What is the overall percentage change?

Multipliers: 1.40 × 0.70 = 0.98
Change = 0.98 - 1 = -0.02 = -2%

Overall: 2% decrease
```

### Example 5: Sale Price Problem
```
A store offers "30% off, then additional 10% off."
Original price: $80. Final price?

After 30% off: $80 × 0.70 = $56
After 10% off: $56 × 0.90 = $50.40

(This is NOT the same as 40% off!)
40% off would be: $80 × 0.60 = $48
```

### Example 6: Profit Percentage
```
An item is bought for $75 and sold for $90.
Find the profit percentage.

Profit = $90 - $75 = $15
Profit % = (15 ÷ 75) × 100 = 20%
```

## 10. Mental Math Tips 🧠

### Quick Multipliers
```
Common percentage changes:

+10% → ×1.1     -10% → ×0.9
+20% → ×1.2     -20% → ×0.8
+25% → ×1.25    -25% → ×0.75
+50% → ×1.5     -50% → ×0.5
+100% → ×2      -100% → ×0
```

### Percentage Change Pairs
```
These pairs are equivalent increases:

+100% = double the value
+200% = triple the value
+300% = quadruple the value

+50% = multiply by 1.5
+33⅓% = multiply by 4/3
+25% = multiply by 1.25
```

### Quick Estimation
```
For small percentages:
Up a% then down a% ≈ down (a²/100)%

Example: Up 10% then down 10%
≈ down (10×10)/100 = down 1%
Actual: 0.99 → 1% down ✓
```

### Reverse Percentage Shortcuts
```
If final = 125% of original:
Original = final × (100/125) = final × 0.8

If final = 80% of original:
Original = final × (100/80) = final × 1.25
```
