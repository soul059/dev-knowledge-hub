## 1. Three Types of Percentage Problems

### Overview
```
Every percentage problem involves THREE quantities:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                         │
│   PART = PERCENTAGE × WHOLE                             │
│                                                         │
│   Part: The portion or amount                           │
│   Percentage: The rate (as decimal)                     │
│   Whole: The total or original amount                   │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Three question types:
1. Find the PART (given % and whole)
2. Find the PERCENTAGE (given part and whole)
3. Find the WHOLE (given % and part)
```

### The Triangle Method
```
                Part
                 /\
                /  \
               /    \
              /      \
             /________\
        Percentage × Whole

Cover what you need to find:
• Cover Part      → Multiply % × Whole
• Cover %         → Divide Part ÷ Whole
• Cover Whole     → Divide Part ÷ %
```

---

## 2. Finding a Percentage of a Number

### The Formula
```
Part = Percentage × Whole

OR

Part = (Percentage ÷ 100) × Whole
```

### Step-by-Step Method
```
Find 25% of 80:

Step 1: Convert percentage to decimal
        25% = 25 ÷ 100 = 0.25

Step 2: Multiply by the whole number
        0.25 × 80 = 20

Answer: 25% of 80 = 20
```

### Alternative Method (Using Fractions)
```
Find 25% of 80:

25% = 25/100 = 1/4

1/4 × 80 = 80/4 = 20

Answer: 25% of 80 = 20
```

### Worked Examples
```
Example 1: Find 15% of 200

Method: 15% = 0.15
        0.15 × 200 = 30
Answer: 30

Example 2: Find 72% of 450

Method: 72% = 0.72
        0.72 × 450 = 324
Answer: 324

Example 3: Find 6.5% of 1200

Method: 6.5% = 0.065
        0.065 × 1200 = 78
Answer: 78
```

---

## 3. Finding What Percentage One Number is of Another

### The Formula
```
Percentage = (Part ÷ Whole) × 100
```

### Step-by-Step Method
```
What percentage is 18 of 72?

Step 1: Divide part by whole
        18 ÷ 72 = 0.25

Step 2: Multiply by 100
        0.25 × 100 = 25%

Answer: 18 is 25% of 72
```

### Worked Examples
```
Example 1: What percentage is 35 of 140?

35 ÷ 140 = 0.25
0.25 × 100 = 25%
Answer: 25%

Example 2: What percentage is 63 of 90?

63 ÷ 90 = 0.7
0.7 × 100 = 70%
Answer: 70%

Example 3: What percentage is 15 of 40?

15 ÷ 40 = 0.375
0.375 × 100 = 37.5%
Answer: 37.5%
```

---

## 4. Finding the Whole When Given a Percentage

### The Formula
```
Whole = Part ÷ (Percentage ÷ 100)

OR

Whole = Part × (100 ÷ Percentage)
```

### Step-by-Step Method
```
20 is 25% of what number?

Step 1: Convert percentage to decimal
        25% = 0.25

Step 2: Divide part by decimal
        20 ÷ 0.25 = 80

Answer: 20 is 25% of 80
```

### Worked Examples
```
Example 1: 45 is 15% of what number?

45 ÷ 0.15 = 300
Answer: 300

Example 2: 84 is 35% of what number?

84 ÷ 0.35 = 240
Answer: 240

Example 3: 6 is 2.5% of what number?

6 ÷ 0.025 = 240
Answer: 240
```

---

## 5. Quick Calculation Methods

### Finding 10% (The Building Block)
```
To find 10%: Divide by 10

10% of 250 = 250 ÷ 10 = 25
10% of 84 = 84 ÷ 10 = 8.4
10% of 1500 = 1500 ÷ 10 = 150
```

### Building Other Percentages from 10%
```
5% = half of 10%
20% = 10% × 2
30% = 10% × 3
15% = 10% + 5%
25% = 10% × 2 + 5%

Example: Find 25% of 80

10% of 80 = 8
5% of 80 = 4 (half of 10%)
25% = 20% + 5% = 16 + 4 = 20

Or: 25% = 10% + 10% + 5% = 8 + 8 + 4 = 20
```

### Finding 1% (For Precision)
```
To find 1%: Divide by 100

1% of 500 = 500 ÷ 100 = 5
1% of 72 = 72 ÷ 100 = 0.72
1% of 3400 = 3400 ÷ 100 = 34

Use 1% to build any percentage:
7% = 7 × 1%
3% = 3 × 1%
```

### Finding 50% (Halving)
```
50% = half of the number

50% of 86 = 86 ÷ 2 = 43
50% of 150 = 150 ÷ 2 = 75
50% of 3.8 = 3.8 ÷ 2 = 1.9
```

---

## 6. Complex Percentage Calculations

### Finding Multiple Percentages
```
Find 17% of 400:

Method 1: Direct calculation
17% = 0.17
0.17 × 400 = 68

Method 2: Build from known percentages
10% of 400 = 40
5% of 400 = 20
2% of 400 = 8
17% = 10% + 5% + 2% = 40 + 20 + 8 = 68
```

### Percentage of a Percentage
```
Find 20% of 30% of 500:

Step 1: 30% of 500 = 0.30 × 500 = 150
Step 2: 20% of 150 = 0.20 × 150 = 30

Answer: 30

Alternative: 20% × 30% = 0.20 × 0.30 = 0.06 = 6%
            6% of 500 = 30
```

### Consecutive Percentages
```
Find 40% of a number if 25% of it is 60:

Step 1: Find the whole number
        60 is 25%, so whole = 60 ÷ 0.25 = 240

Step 2: Find 40% of the whole
        40% of 240 = 0.40 × 240 = 96

Answer: 96
```

## 7. Real-World Applications

### Sales and Discounts
```
A shirt costs $45. It's on sale for 20% off.
How much do you save? What's the sale price?

Savings: 20% of $45 = 0.20 × 45 = $9

Sale price: $45 - $9 = $36

OR: 80% of $45 = 0.80 × 45 = $36
```

### Tips and Gratuity
```
Restaurant bill: $75
You want to leave a 18% tip.
How much is the tip?

18% of $75 = 0.18 × 75 = $13.50

Total: $75 + $13.50 = $88.50
```

### Test Scores
```
You got 42 out of 50 questions correct.
What is your percentage score?

(42 ÷ 50) × 100 = 0.84 × 100 = 84%
```

### Tax Calculations
```
Price: $120
Tax rate: 8.5%

Tax amount: 8.5% of $120 = 0.085 × 120 = $10.20

Total price: $120 + $10.20 = $130.20
```

## 9. Solved Examples

### Example 1: Finding the Part
```
A class has 35 students. 60% of them passed the exam.
How many students passed?

60% of 35 = 0.60 × 35 = 21 students passed
```

### Example 2: Finding the Percentage
```
Out of 80 employees, 12 called in sick.
What percentage were sick?

(12 ÷ 80) × 100 = 0.15 × 100 = 15%
```

### Example 3: Finding the Whole
```
A 15% tip was $9.
What was the original bill?

$9 ÷ 0.15 = $60

The original bill was $60
```

### Example 4: Multi-Step Problem
```
A store marks up items by 40%, then offers 25% off.
Original cost: $50. What's the final price?

Step 1: 40% markup
        40% of $50 = $20
        Marked price = $50 + $20 = $70

Step 2: 25% discount
        25% of $70 = $17.50
        Final price = $70 - $17.50 = $52.50

Note: The final price ($52.50) is NOT the same as
      the original ($50). The order matters!
```

### Example 5: Reverse Calculation
```
After a 20% discount, a TV costs $480.
What was the original price?

If 20% off, then $480 = 80% of original
Original = $480 ÷ 0.80 = $600

Check: 20% of $600 = $120
       $600 - $120 = $480 ✓
```

### Example 6: Commission Problem
```
A salesperson earns 8% commission.
They sold $12,500 worth of products.
How much commission did they earn?

8% of $12,500 = 0.08 × 12,500 = $1,000
```

## 10. Mental Math Tips 🧠

### The 10% Rule
```
Master 10% and build everything else:

10% = ÷ 10 (just move decimal one left)

10% of 847 = 84.7
10% of 60 = 6
10% of 3.5 = 0.35
```

### Percentage Shortcuts
```
5% = half of 10%
15% = 10% + 5%
20% = 10% × 2
25% = divide by 4
50% = divide by 2
75% = 50% + 25%
```

### Flip Method (For Finding Whole)
```
If 25% = some value, then 100% = value × 4
If 20% = some value, then 100% = value × 5
If 10% = some value, then 100% = value × 10
If 5% = some value, then 100% = value × 20

Example: 25% = 30, so 100% = 30 × 4 = 120
```

### Quick Estimation
```
Round to friendly percentages:

17% ≈ 20% (slightly high estimate)
23% ≈ 25% (slightly high estimate)
48% ≈ 50% (close enough)
72% ≈ 70% or 75% (choose nearest)
```
