## 🔢 Quick Reference: Key Formulas

### Algebraic Identities

| Identity | Formula |
|----------|---------|
| Square of Sum | $(a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²$ |
| Square of Difference | $(a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²$ |
| Difference of Squares | $a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)$ |
| Sum of Cubes | $a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²)$ |
| Difference of Cubes | $a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²)$ |

### Quadratic Equations

| Concept | Formula |
|---------|---------|
| Standard Form | $ax² + bx + c = 0$ |
| Quadratic Formula | $x = \frac{-b ± \sqrt{b² - 4ac}}{2a}$ |
| Discriminant | $D = b² - 4ac$ |
| Sum of Roots | $α + β = -\frac{b}{a}$ |
| Product of Roots | $αβ = \frac{c}{a}$ |

### Progressions

| Type | nth Term | Sum of n Terms |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Arithmetic | $a_n = a + (n-1)d$ | $S_n = \frac{n}{2}[2a + (n-1)d]$ |
| Geometric | $a_n = ar^{n-1}$ | $S_n = a\frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}$ (r ≠ 1) |
