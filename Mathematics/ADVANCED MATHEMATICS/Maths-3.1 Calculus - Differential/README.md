# 📐 Calculus — Differential

## Course Overview

**Differential Calculus** is one of the two principal branches of calculus (the other being integral calculus). It deals with the study of **rates of change** and **slopes of curves**. Starting from the foundational concept of a *function*, we build through *limits*, *continuity*, and *differentiability* to arrive at the powerful machinery of *differentiation* — a tool that lets us analyze how quantities change, find optimal values, approximate functions, and sketch curves with precision.

This course takes a **theory-first, concept-building** approach. Every definition is motivated, every rule is derived, and every application is grounded in the mathematics that precedes it.

## How to Use These Notes

1. **Follow the order** — each unit builds on the previous one.
2. **Work through examples** — don't just read; pick up a pen and verify every step.
3. **Attempt revision questions** before looking at answers.
4. **Refer to summary tables** at the end of each chapter for quick revision.
5. **Use navigation links** at the bottom of each file to move between chapters.
