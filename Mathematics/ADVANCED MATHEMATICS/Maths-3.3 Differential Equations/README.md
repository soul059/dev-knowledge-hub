## Course Overview

Differential Equations form the mathematical backbone of modeling real-world phenomena — from population growth and radioactive decay to electrical circuits and mechanical vibrations. This course covers **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)** systematically, building from first-order equations to systems, series solutions, and transform methods.

### What You Will Learn

| Area | Key Skills |
|------|-----------|
| **Foundations** | Classify ODEs by order, degree, linearity; form DEs from families of curves |
| **First Order Methods** | Solve separable, homogeneous, linear, exact, and Bernoulli equations |
| **Higher Degree** | Handle Clairaut's and Lagrange's equations; find singular solutions |
| **Applications** | Model circuits (RL, RC, LCR), oscillations, growth/decay, trajectories |
| **Higher Order** | Solve constant-coefficient ODEs; use Wronskian and reduction of order |
| **Non-Homogeneous** | Apply undetermined coefficients, variation of parameters, D-operator |
| **Systems** | Convert to first-order systems; use matrix methods and phase planes |
| **Series Solutions** | Power series, Frobenius method, Bessel and Legendre equations |
