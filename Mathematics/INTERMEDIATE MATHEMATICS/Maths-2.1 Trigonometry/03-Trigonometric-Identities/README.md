# Unit 3: Trigonometric Identities

## Overview

Trigonometric identities are equations that are true for all values of the variable(s) for which both sides are defined. They are essential tools for simplifying expressions, solving equations, and proving other mathematical results. This unit covers all fundamental identities and techniques for proving them.

### The Three Pythagorean Identities

$$\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$$

$$1 + \tan^2\theta = \sec^2\theta$$

$$1 + \cot^2\theta = \csc^2\theta$$

### Reciprocal Identities

    │   sin θ · csc θ = 1                     │
    │   cos θ · sec θ = 1                     │
    │   tan θ · cot θ = 1                     │
    │                                         │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Quotient Identities

$$\tan\theta = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta} \qquad \cot\theta = \frac{\cos\theta}{\sin\theta}$$
