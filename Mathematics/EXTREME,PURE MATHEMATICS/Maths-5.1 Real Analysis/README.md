# Real Analysis — Comprehensive Study Notes

> **A rigorous treatment of the foundations of calculus and mathematical analysis**

---

## Course Overview

Real Analysis is the branch of mathematics that rigorously develops the theory underlying calculus. It begins with the construction and properties of the real number system and proceeds through sequences, series, topology, continuity, differentiation, and integration — all built upon precise definitions and formal proofs.

These notes emphasize **theory, logical concept building, and rigorous proof techniques**. Each chapter builds on previous results, creating a coherent logical structure from axioms to advanced theorems.

### Prerequisites
- Calculus (single variable)
- Basic set theory and logic
- Mathematical proof techniques (direct, contradiction, induction)

### How to Use These Notes
- Read chapters **sequentially** within each unit — concepts build on each other
- Pay close attention to **definitions** — in analysis, precise language is everything
- Work through the **examples** step by step before attempting revision questions
- Use **summary tables** for quick review before exams
