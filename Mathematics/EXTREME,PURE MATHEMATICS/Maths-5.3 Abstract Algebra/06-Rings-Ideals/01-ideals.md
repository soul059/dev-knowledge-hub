## Overview

**Ideals** are the ring-theoretic analogue of normal subgroups: they are precisely the kernels of ring homomorphisms, and they let us form **quotient rings**. This chapter defines ideals, develops tests for recognising them, and explores key examples.

## 1. Definition

**Definition.** A subset $I \subseteq R$ is an **ideal** of $R$ (written $I \trianglelefteq R$) if:

1. $(I, +)$ is a subgroup of $(R, +)$
2. $ra \in I$ and $ar \in I$ for all $r \in R$, $a \in I$ (**absorption**)

Condition 2 splits into:
- **Left ideal:** $ra \in I$ for all $r \in R, a \in I$
- **Right ideal:** $ar \in I$ for all $r \in R, a \in I$
- **Two-sided ideal:** both (this is "ideal" for commutative rings)

```
  Ideal = additive subgroup that "absorbs" multiplication
  
  Normal subgroup (groups)  ↔  Ideal (rings)
  
  Group: gNg⁻¹ ⊆ N           Ring: rI ⊆ I and Ir ⊆ I
  → can form G/N              → can form R/I
```

## 2. Ideal Test

**Theorem 6.1 (Ideal Test).** A non-empty subset $I \subseteq R$ is an ideal iff:

1. $a - b \in I$ for all $a, b \in I$
2. $ra \in I$ and $ar \in I$ for all $r \in R, a \in I$

**Note.** Condition 2 implies $a \cdot b \in I$ for $a \in I, b \in I$ (since $b \in R$). Combined with condition 1, $I$ is automatically an additive subgroup.

In a **commutative ring**, left ideal = right ideal = two-sided ideal, so we only need:

1. $a - b \in I$ for all $a, b \in I$
2. $ra \in I$ for all $r \in R, a \in I$

## 3. Examples

### 3.1. Trivial Ideals

Every ring has two trivial ideals:
- $\{0\}$ (zero ideal)
- $R$ (the whole ring)

A ring where these are the **only** ideals is called **simple**.

### 3.2. $n\mathbb{Z}$ in $\mathbb{Z}$

$n\mathbb{Z} = \{nk : k \in \mathbb{Z}\} = \{\ldots, -2n, -n, 0, n, 2n, \ldots\}$

**Check:** $nk - nl = n(k-l) \in n\mathbb{Z}$ ✓; $m \cdot nk = n(mk) \in n\mathbb{Z}$ ✓.

**Fact:** These are **all** ideals of $\mathbb{Z}$. ($\mathbb{Z}$ is a PID.)

### 3.3. Kernel of a Ring Homomorphism

If $\varphi: R \to S$ is a ring homomorphism, then $\ker\varphi = \{r \in R : \varphi(r) = 0\}$ is an ideal.

### 3.4. The Ideal $(x)$ in $R[x]$

$(x) = \{f(x) \in R[x] : f(0) = 0\}$ = polynomials with zero constant term.

### 3.5. Maximal and Zero Ideals in $\mathbb{Z}_n$

The ideals of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ correspond to divisors of $n$.

Ideals of $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$: $\{0\}, \langle 6\rangle, \langle 4\rangle, \langle 3\rangle, \langle 2\rangle, \mathbb{Z}_{12}$.

```
  Ideal lattice of Z₁₂:
  
         Z₁₂
        / | \
     ⟨2⟩ ⟨3⟩ ⟨4⟩
       \ |  / |
       ⟨6⟩  ⟨4⟩
         \ /
         {0}
         
  Actually (corrected):
         Z₁₂
        / |  \
     ⟨2⟩ ⟨3⟩  ⟨4⟩
      |   \ / |
      |  ⟨6⟩  |
       \  |  /
        {0}
```

## 4. Principal Ideals

**Definition.** An ideal generated by a single element $a \in R$ is called **principal**:

$$(a) = Ra = \{ra : r \in R\} = aR$$

(In a commutative ring with unity, $(a) = \{ra : r \in R\} = aR$.)

More generally, $(a) = RaR = \{\sum r_i a s_i\}$ in a non-commutative ring.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{Z}$: every ideal is principal. $(6) = 6\mathbb{Z}$.
- In $\mathbb{Z}[x]$: $(2, x) = \{2f(x) + xg(x) : f, g \in \mathbb{Z}[x]\}$ is NOT principal.

---

## 5. Ideal Generated by a Set

**Definition.** The ideal generated by $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in R$ is:

$$(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) = \left\{\sum_{i=1}^{n} r_i a_i : r_i \in R\right\}$$

(in a commutative ring with unity).

### Example: $(2, x)$ in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$

$(2, x) = \{2f(x) + xg(x) : f, g \in \mathbb{Z}[x]\}$

This is the set of all polynomials with **even constant term**.

This ideal is **not principal**: if $(2, x) = (p(x))$, then $p \mid 2$ and $p \mid x$ in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, forcing $p = \pm 1$, but then $(p) = \mathbb{Z}[x] \neq (2, x)$.

---

## 6. Operations on Ideals

| Operation | Definition | Result |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Sum | $I + J = \{a + b : a \in I, b \in J\}$ | Ideal |
| Product | $IJ = \{\sum a_i b_i : a_i \in I, b_i \in J\}$ | Ideal, $IJ \subseteq I \cap J$ |
| Intersection | $I \cap J$ | Ideal |
| Radical | $\sqrt{I} = \{a : a^n \in I \text{ for some } n\}$ | Ideal |

**Important:** $I \cup J$ is generally **not** an ideal.

### Properties

- $I + J$ is the smallest ideal containing both $I$ and $J$.
- $IJ \subseteq I \cap J \subseteq I, J \subseteq I + J$.
- If $I + J = R$ (coprime ideals), then $IJ = I \cap J$.

## 7. Ideals and Units

**Theorem 6.2.** An ideal $I$ of $R$ contains a unit iff $I = R$.

*Proof.* If $u \in I$ is a unit, then $1 = u^{-1} u \in I$ (by absorption), so for any $r \in R$: $r = r \cdot 1 \in I$. $\blacksquare$

**Corollary.** A field $F$ has only two ideals: $\{0\}$ and $F$.

**Corollary.** A commutative ring with $1$ is a field iff its only ideals are $\{0\}$ and $R$.
