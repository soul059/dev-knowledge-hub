## Overview

A **subring** is a subset of a ring that is itself a ring under the same operations. We develop subring tests and explore important examples including centres, polynomial subrings, and rings of algebraic integers.

## 1. Definition

**Definition.** A subset $S \subseteq R$ is a **subring** of $R$ if:
1. $S$ is closed under addition and multiplication
2. $S$ contains the additive identity $0$
3. $S$ is closed under additive inverses
4. (If we require unity:) $1_R \in S$

**Note:** Some texts do not require $1 \in S$. We follow the convention that subrings share the same unity.

---

## 2. Subring Test

**Theorem 5.2 (Subring Test).** A non-empty subset $S \subseteq R$ is a subring iff:

1. $a - b \in S$ for all $a, b \in S$ (subtraction closure)
2. $ab \in S$ for all $a, b \in S$ (multiplication closure)
3. $1 \in S$

```
  Subring Test Checklist:
  
  □  S ≠ ∅  (usually check 1 ∈ S)
  □  a - b ∈ S   for all a, b ∈ S
  □  a · b ∈ S   for all a, b ∈ S
  □  1_R ∈ S     (if requiring unity)
  
  All four ⟹ S is a subring of R
```

*Why subtraction suffices for the additive part:* Taking $a = b$ gives $0 \in S$; taking $a = 0$ gives $-b \in S$; then $a + b = a - (-b) \in S$.

## 3. Examples of Subrings

### 3.1. Standard Number Subrings

```
  ℤ  ⊆  ℚ  ⊆  ℝ  ⊆  ℂ
  
  Each is a subring of the next.
```

### 3.2. Gaussian Integers

$\mathbb{Z}[i] = \{a + bi : a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\} \subseteq \mathbb{C}$

**Verification:**
- $(a+bi) - (c+di) = (a-c) + (b-d)i \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ ✓
- $(a+bi)(c+di) = (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ ✓
- $1 = 1 + 0i \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ ✓

### 3.3. $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$

$\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}] = \{a + b\sqrt{d} : a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ for any $d \in \mathbb{Z}$ (not a perfect square).

Subring of $\mathbb{R}$ (if $d > 0$) or $\mathbb{C}$ (if $d < 0$).

### 3.4. Upper Triangular Matrices

$$T_n(R) = \left\{\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\ & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & & a_{nn} \end{pmatrix}\right\} \subseteq M_n(R)$$

Subring of $M_n(R)$. Closed under subtraction and multiplication, contains $I_n$.

### 3.5. Centre of a Ring

$$Z(R) = \{z \in R : zr = rz \text{ for all } r \in R\}$$

**Proposition 5.3.** $Z(R)$ is a commutative subring of $R$ containing $1$.

### 3.6. Even Integers $2\mathbb{Z}$

$2\mathbb{Z}$ is closed under subtraction and multiplication, but $1 \notin 2\mathbb{Z}$.

So $2\mathbb{Z}$ is a subring **without unity** (or "rng" / "pseudo-ring").

---

## 4. Generated Subrings

**Definition.** Given $R$ and elements $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \in R$, the **subring generated** by $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n$ over a subring $S$ is:

$$S[\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n] = \text{smallest subring of } R \text{ containing } S \text{ and all } \alpha_i$$

### Example: $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$

$\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ is the smallest subring of $\mathbb{R}$ containing $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\sqrt{2}$.

$$\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}] = \{a + b\sqrt{2} : a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$

### Example: $\mathbb{Z}[i, \sqrt{2}]$

$$\mathbb{Z}[i, \sqrt{2}] = \{a + bi + c\sqrt{2} + di\sqrt{2} : a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$

---

## 5. Subring Lattice

Just as for groups, subrings form a lattice under inclusion.

### Subrings of $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$

The subrings of $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ (containing 1) are:

```
              Z₁₂
             /    \
           {0,2,4,6,8,10}  ← but this doesn't contain 1!
           
  Actually, subrings of Z₁₂ containing 1:
  
  Z₁₂ itself (all elements)
  {0, 1, 2, ..., 11} = Z₁₂
  
  In Z_n, the only subring containing 1 is Z_n itself.
  (Since 1 generates all of Z_n under addition.)
```

### Subrings of $\mathbb{Q}$

```
           ℚ
          / \
         ℤ   ℤ[1/2]   ℤ[1/3]   ℤ[1/p] ...
          \   /         |
           ℤ            ℤ
```

$\mathbb{Z}[1/p] = \{a/p^n : a \in \mathbb{Z}, n \geq 0\}$: integers with denominators that are powers of $p$.

---

## 6. Intersection of Subrings

**Proposition 5.4.** The intersection of any collection of subrings of $R$ is a subring.

*Proof.* If $\{S_i\}$ are subrings and $S = \bigcap S_i$: $1 \in S$ (since $1 \in$ each $S_i$), and closure under subtraction and multiplication follows from closure in each $S_i$. $\blacksquare$

This justifies defining "subring generated by a set" as the intersection of all subrings containing that set.

---

## 7. Direct Product of Rings

**Definition.** Given rings $R$ and $S$, the **direct product** $R \times S$ has:
- Elements: $(r, s)$ with $r \in R$, $s \in S$
- Addition: $(r_1, s_1) + (r_2, s_2) = (r_1 + r_2, s_1 + s_2)$
- Multiplication: $(r_1, s_1)(r_2, s_2) = (r_1 r_2, s_1 s_2)$
- Unity: $(1_R, 1_S)$

**Example:** By CRT, $\mathbb{Z}_6 \cong \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$.

## 8. Non-Examples

| Subset | Why not a subring |
|--------|-------------------|
| $\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ | Not closed under subtraction |
| $2\mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ | No unity ($1 \notin 2\mathbb{Z}$) |
| $\{0, 2, 4\} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_6$ | Not closed under mult. ($2 \cdot 2 = 4$, $4 \cdot 4 = 4$, $2 \cdot 4 = 2$... actually this is closed, but $1 \notin \{0,2,4\}$) |
| Irrational numbers | Not closed under anything |

---

## Summary Table

| Concept | Key Fact |
|---------|----------|
| Subring | Subset closed under $+, -, \cdot$, containing $1$ |
| Subring test | $1 \in S$; $a-b, ab \in S$ for all $a, b \in S$ |
| Centre $Z(R)$ | Commutative subring of elements commuting with all of $R$ |
| Generated subring | $S[\alpha] = $ smallest subring containing $S$ and $\alpha$ |
| Intersection | $\bigcap S_i$ is a subring if each $S_i$ is |
| Direct product | $R \times S$ with component-wise operations |
