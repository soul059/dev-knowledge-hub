## Overview

A **splitting field** of a polynomial is the smallest extension over which the polynomial factors completely into linear factors. Splitting fields always exist and are unique up to isomorphism. They are the natural setting for studying roots and lead directly to Galois theory.

## 1. Definition

**Definition.** Let $f \in F[x]$ be a polynomial of degree $n$. A **splitting field** of $f$ over $F$ is a field extension $E/F$ such that:

1. $f$ splits completely in $E[x]$: $f(x) = a(x - \alpha_1)(x - \alpha_2) \cdots (x - \alpha_n)$ with $\alpha_i \in E$.
2. $E = F(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n)$ — $E$ is generated by the roots.

"$E$ is the smallest field over $F$ in which $f$ factors completely."

---

## 2. Existence

**Theorem 8.14.** Every non-constant $f \in F[x]$ has a splitting field.

*Proof (by induction on degree).*

Base: $\deg f = 1$. Then $E = F$ works.

Inductive step: Let $p(x)$ be an irreducible factor of $f$. Set $E_1 = F[x]/(p(x))$. Then $p$ has a root $\alpha_1 \in E_1$, so $f(x) = (x - \alpha_1)g(x)$ in $E_1[x]$. By induction, $g$ has a splitting field $E$ over $E_1$. Then $E$ is a splitting field of $f$ over $F$. $\blacksquare$

**Degree bound:** $[E:F] \leq n!$ where $n = \deg f$.

```
  Building a splitting field step by step:
  
  f(x) ∈ F[x], degree n
  
  F ──adjoin root α₁──▸ F(α₁) ──adjoin α₂──▸ F(α₁,α₂) ──...──▸ F(α₁,...,αₙ) = E
  
  At each step: adjoin a root of the remaining factor.
  Degree at most multiplies by deg of remaining factor.
  Total: [E:F] divides n!
```

## 3. Uniqueness

**Theorem 8.15 (Uniqueness of Splitting Fields).** If $E_1$ and $E_2$ are both splitting fields of $f \in F[x]$ over $F$, then $E_1 \cong E_2$ via an isomorphism fixing $F$.

*Proof idea.* Extend the identity $F \to F$ root by root, using the fact that irreducible polynomials have roots in any splitting field and that the extension of isomorphisms is always possible (Isomorphism Extension Theorem). $\blacksquare$

## 4. Examples

### 4.1 $f(x) = x^2 + 1$ over $\mathbb{R}$

Roots: $\pm i$. Splitting field: $\mathbb{R}(i) = \mathbb{C}$. Degree $[\mathbb{C}:\mathbb{R}] = 2$.

### 4.2 $f(x) = x^3 - 2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$

Roots: $\sqrt[3]{2}, \omega\sqrt[3]{2}, \omega^2\sqrt[3]{2}$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$.

Splitting field: $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}, \omega)$.

$[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}):\mathbb{Q}] = 3$ (min poly $x^3 - 2$).

$[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}, \omega):\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})] = 2$ (min poly $x^2 + x + 1$).

$[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}, \omega):\mathbb{Q}] = 6$.

```
  Splitting field of x³ - 2 over ℚ:
  
        ℚ(∛2, ω)           degree 6 over ℚ
        /       \
    ℚ(∛2)      ℚ(ω)        degrees 3 and 2 over ℚ
        \       /
           ℚ
  
  Roots: ∛2,  ω∛2,  ω²∛2
  (where ω = e^{2πi/3}, primitive cube root of unity)
```

### 4.3 $f(x) = x^4 - 2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$

Roots: $\sqrt[4]{2}, i\sqrt[4]{2}, -\sqrt[4]{2}, -i\sqrt[4]{2}$.

Splitting field: $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}, i)$. Degree $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}, i):\mathbb{Q}] = 8$.

### 4.4 $f(x) = x^2 - 2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$

Roots: $\pm\sqrt{2}$. Splitting field: $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$. Degree $= 2$.

(Both roots are in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ since $-\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$.)

### 4.5 $f(x) = x^{p^n} - x$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$

Splitting field: $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$.

## 5. Normal Extensions

**Definition.** A finite extension $E/F$ is **normal** if every irreducible polynomial $f \in F[x]$ that has at least one root in $E$ splits completely in $E$.

**Theorem 8.16.** The following are equivalent for a finite extension $E/F$:
1. $E/F$ is normal
2. $E$ is the splitting field of some polynomial $f \in F[x]$

**Examples:**
- $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})/\mathbb{Q}$: normal (splitting field of $x^2 - 2$).
- $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})/\mathbb{Q}$: **NOT** normal ($x^3 - 2$ has one root in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ but doesn't split there — the other roots are complex).
- $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}, \omega)/\mathbb{Q}$: normal (splitting field of $x^3 - 2$).

```
  Normal vs not normal:
  
  E = ℚ(∛2):  x³ - 2 has root ∛2 ∈ E, but ω∛2 ∉ E.
  So x³ - 2 does NOT split in E.
  ⟹ ℚ(∛2)/ℚ is NOT normal.
  
  E = ℚ(∛2, ω):  x³ - 2 splits as (x-∛2)(x-ω∛2)(x-ω²∛2), all ∈ E.
  ⟹ ℚ(∛2, ω)/ℚ IS normal.
```

## 6. Separable Extensions

**Definition.** A polynomial $f \in F[x]$ is **separable** if it has no repeated roots in its splitting field. An algebraic element $\alpha$ is separable if its minimal polynomial is separable.

$E/F$ is a **separable extension** if every $\alpha \in E$ is separable over $F$.

**Theorem 8.17.** In characteristic 0, every irreducible polynomial is separable. Hence every algebraic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ is separable.

**Theorem 8.18.** In characteristic $p$, an irreducible $f$ is inseparable $\iff$ $f(x) = g(x^p)$ for some $g$.

**Example of inseparability:** Over $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$, the polynomial $x^p - t$ is irreducible and inseparable: it factors as $(x - \alpha)^p$ where $\alpha^p = t$.

## 7. Algebraic Closure Revisited

**Definition.** An **algebraic closure** $\overline{F}$ is the splitting field of the set of ALL polynomials in $F[x]$.

| Base field | Algebraic closure |
|-----------|-------------------|
| $\mathbb{Q}$ | $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ (algebraic numbers in $\mathbb{C}$) |
| $\mathbb{R}$ | $\mathbb{C}$ |
| $\mathbb{F}_p$ | $\overline{\mathbb{F}_p} = \bigcup_{n \geq 1} \mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ |
| $\mathbb{C}$ | $\mathbb{C}$ (already closed) |

## Summary Table
